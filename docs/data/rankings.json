          "body": "## What's New\r\n#### Added\r\n- Added **MIDI** support, allowing some games to play MIDI audio. The software comes with an open-source soundfont by [default](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1517), and you can also install your preferred soundfont in the `Settings` (currently, only SF2 format is supported). Download Windows MIDI Soundfont [here](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/713).\r\n- Improved **OpenXR** suooport. Many thanks to **Luboš V.** , his work making OpenXR support possible and better.\r\n- Improved Game Controller Support, you can now selectively use **XInput** or **DInput** mapping. Linear triggers now work with both mapping modes. For trigger button, if it’s not working correctly, try adjusting the trigger button mode in the `Settings` to match your controller.\r\n- Added the feature to automatically set the container's **Locale**. You can now also adjust `LC_ALL` settings in the container editing interface.\r\n- Added Landscape And **Portrait Mode** switching features. You can now switch to portrait mode using the container's resolution settings or `Toggle Orientation` button of the left-side navigation bar.\r\n- Added the ability to reconfigure containers. You can now click `Reconfigure` in the container options to reconfigure the Wine prefix on the next startup.\r\n  \r\n#### Fixed\r\n- Fixed the stuttering issue when exiting the container.\r\n- Fixed the issue where shortcuts on the desktop remained available after deleting the container.\r\n- Fixed the issue with binding gamepad analog sticks in InputControlEditor.\r\n- Fixed the issue that shortcuts sometimes lost their settings.\r\n- Fixed the issue where clicking on the screen and input controls simultaneously in touch screen simulation mode caused crashes.\r\n- Fixed the missing End key issue in InputControlEditor.\r\n- Fixed the issue when creating a new container would reset the version and preset of box64.\r\n- Fixed the issue where groups in the box64 rc file could not be disabled.\r\n- Fixed the issue where the mouse pointer was inaccurate when using simulated touch screen in full-screen mode.\r\n- Fixed the issue where the file provider did not support moving files.\r\n- Fixed the issue where reinstalling the file system sometimes skipped the opt folder.\r\n- Fixed the issue where external storage could not be added as a Wine drive.\r\n  \r\n#### Changed\r\n- Update Wine to 9.16.\r\n- File provider enabled by default.\r\n- Added gst-libav.\r\n  \r\n####  What's new about OpenXR Support?\r\n- Fixed the issue causing crashes at startup.\r\n- Fixed 3DoF support to ensure it functions correctly, rather than running in 2DoF mode.\r\n- Fixed some graphical glitches on the Meta Quest 3.\r\n- Added controller mapping functionality in the settings.\r\n- Fixed the black screen issue on QuestOS V69.\r\n  \r\n#### FAQ\r\n1. #### What is Winlator with Native Glibc?\r\n   Many thanks to **BrunoSX** for developing [Winlator](https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator), a practical and popular PC simulation software. Winlator Glibc is not an upgrade but a mod to Winlator. It uses Glibc patches from Termux-pacman to build the necessary packages, achieving the same goals as the Proot-based solution but without the I/O performance loss associated with Proot. However, due to the exclusion of Arm32 and limitations in Wine's support for wow64, its compatibility with 32-bit applications is not as good as the vanilla Winlator.\r\n1. #### Where to Get Latest Turnip Driver?\r\n   Thanks to **K11MCH1** and **JeezDisReez**, the latest Mesa Turnip drivers are available for Winlator and can be found [K11MCH1/WinlatorTurnipDrivers](https://github.com/K11MCH1/WinlatorTurnipDrivers).\r\n3. #### Why not Include the New Box64 and Drivers in App?\r\n   Box64 and the Turnip Driver are updated frequently, so installing them externally ensures they are always up to date. Therefore, the app only includes their latest release versions.\r\n4. #### Reinstall or Overwrite?\r\n   You do not need to uninstall the old Winlator Glibc before installation. However, if you have installed a different version, you must uninstall it before installing the new one due to different signatures. Please make sure to **BACK UP** your data.\r\n5. #### Game has Sound but Blank.\r\n   Try using box64 version 0.3.0 or earlier and try using wine-9.2.\r\n4. #### What is .wcp?\r\n   **.wcp** is the file extension for add-ons. It is compressed using **XZ** or **Zstd** and includes a **profile.json** file as a manifest. You can create your own add-on files containing various contents. Since these files often include executable programs, **make sure** to verify that add-ons from other sources do not contain malicious software before installation.\r\n6. #### What is .rcp?\r\n   **.rcp** is the file extension for custom Box64 configuration files. It uses a JSON data structure and can be used to generate a box64rc file that Box64 can read. You can refer to [official box64rc](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/main/system/box64.box64rc) to configure the rcp file, but you **cannot** import it directly.\r\n  \r\n**Additional Files**:\r\n1. **box64-0.3.1-0450371.wcp**: contains `box64-0.3.1`, built from [ptitSeb/box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/commit/0450371e282bd5c4dbbceaeca590626304609036).\r\n3. **box64-0.3.1-0450371-8g2.wcp**: contains `box64-0.3.1`, built from [ptitSeb/box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/commit/0450371e282bd5c4dbbceaeca590626304609036). Disabled BAD_SIGNAL for 8gen2 and enabled the 8G2 option, which **may** improve performance.\r\n7. **box64-0.2.7.wcp**: contains `box64-0.2.7`, built from [ptitSeb/box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64).\r\n8. **wine-9.2-custom.wcp**: contains `wine-9.2`. Added MIDI support and improved controller support for Wine 9.2. Please avoid using the older version of Wine 9.2.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* OpenXR - Fix crash on init by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/36\r\n* midi: Add midi support. by @longjunyu2 in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/38\r\n* OpenXR - Fix 3DoF by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/40\r\n* controller: Try fix controller issues. by @longjunyu2 in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/44\r\n* OpenXR - Reopening fixed by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/46\r\n* OpenXR - Fix 3DoF camera by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/47\r\n* OpenXR - Workaround for graphical glitches by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/50\r\n* OpenXR - Controller mapping in settings by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/52\r\n* OpenXR - Crash fix by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/53\r\n* Fixed cannot see changes of input controls until reset. by @longjunyu2 in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/56\r\n* OpenXR - Fix for QuestOS V69 by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/58\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @lvonasek made their first contribution in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/36\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/compare/v7.1.2...v7.1.3",

True touchscreen support requires implementing the XInput2 extension.\r\n- Added support for Chinese. And any corrections to the translation are welcome.\r\n- Added an `content manager`, allowing you to install Wine, graphics drivers, or DX wrappers externally.\r\n- Added the ability to reinstall system files, allowing recovery even if the system files are accidentally damaged.\r\n- Added more VKD3D feature level options.\r\n- Added android `file provider` feature, allowing access to the Winlator data directory through the file manager.\r\n- Added the ability to add `shortcuts` to the home screen, allowing you to launch your programs directly from the desktop. Shortcut changes will be synced in real-time.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed\r\n- Fixed the crash issue that occurred when running programs with long Japanese or Chinese titles.\r\n- Corrected the button styling in the DXVK configuration dialog.\r\n- Fixed certain abnormal issues on some SoCs (such as 870), by compiling Box64 with the `BAD_SIGNAL` parameter enabled.\r\n- Fixed an issue that caused Steam to crash by removing the patch for `iphalpapi` in Wine.\r\n- Fixed the font configuration, you can now add custom fonts to `imagefs/usr/share/fonts`.\r\n\r\n#### Changed\r\n- Set DXVK parameters via environment variables instead of configuration files, allowing for custom DXVK configuration files.\r\n- Hide the system pointer when using an external mouse. Thanks to **xoureldeen** for the method.\r\n- Removed the built-in `DXVK-0.96`, `DXVK-1.10.3`, and `Box64-0.3.1-dev`.

After months of work the next major evolution of Winlator Cmod has arrived. I teased that a controller revolution was coming, but the reality is so much bigger. This isn't just an update; it's a top-to-bottom overhaul focused on bringing a native, seamless gaming experience to your device.\r\n\r\nThis release is the culmination of a journey, and I'm proud to share it with you.\r\n\r\n✨ What's New in Cmod v13 ✨\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n### 🎮 The Controller Revolution: Native Gamepad Support is Here!\r\n\r\nThe old input methods are gone (sorta), replaced by a completely new, from-the-ground-up controller implementation built on a native SDL2 backend.\r\n\r\n-   **Native XInput & DInput Support:** No more switching settings per game! Controllers are now treated like real controllers. If it works on a PC, it should just work here.\r\n\r\n-   **Multiplayer (Up to 4 Players!):** You heard that right. Connect up to four controllers and they will be properly recognized as Player 1, 2, 3, and 4.\r\n\r\n-   **Vibration / Rumble:** Feel the action with full haptic feedback support. It can be toggled on or off.\r\n\r\n-   **Advanced Motion Controls (Gyro):** A completely revamped and customizable gyroscope implementation. Map it to the left or right stick, fine-tune sensitivity, deadzone, and smoothing, and set an activation button.\r\n\r\n-   **Turbo & Macros:** Set up autofire for any button (including triggers!) for each of your controllers.\r\n\r\n-   **Virtual Gamepad Enhancements:** The on-screen controls are now more responsive than ever, with reactive visual feedback to show when a button is pressed.\r\n\r\n### 🔊 ALSA-Reflector: The Unbreakable Audio Engine\r\n\r\nSo- you're in a game, you connect your Bluetooth headphones or a phone call comes in, and the audio dies, forcing a restart. **Those days are over.**\r\n\r\n-   **Introducing \"ALSA-Reflector\":** A new, optional audio driver that creates a virtual, unbreakable audio sink. It provides stable back-pressure to Wine, completely immune to Android's device changes.\r\n\r\n-   **Seamless Recovery:** Real audio is mirrored to your hardware. If the connection breaks, the playback stream is automatically rebuilt in the background without interrupting the game's audio flow. The music never stops. (Well... it might, it's a work in progress!)\r\n\r\n### 🚀 Core System & Proton Enhancements\r\n\r\n-   **Bionic Native Libs:** Thanks to **@Pipetto-Crypto**, Winlator Cmod now uses native Bionic libraries.\r\n\r\n### 🎨 UI & Quality-of-Life Tsunami\r\n\r\n-   **Favorite Shortcut Launcher:** See that new star icon in the toolbar? Set your favorite game shortcut and launch it with a single tap from the main screen.\r\n\r\n-   **\"Disable Touchscreen Mouse\" Option:** You can now completely disable the touchscreen as a mouse input device when using a virtual gamepad.\r\n\r\n-   **Countless Fixes:** From custom shortcut icons and `.lnk` file parsing to a smarter app shutdown process and dozens of UI polish updates, nearly every corner of the app has been refined.\r\n\r\nThe Journey & Thank You\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThis release absolutely would not have been possible alone.\r\n\r\n-   A massive thank you to **@Pipetto-crypto** for his phenomenal work on the graphics wrappers, Bionic native libraries, for taking the time to teach me the intricacies of compiling bionic native libraries, and for keeping the Cmod torch lit while I was on break.\r\n\r\n-   To **@K11MCH1** for pushing me to learn how to compile Bionic libs in the first place and [his excellent videos,](https://www.youtube.com/@Zerokimchii) and the entire **EmuGear Discord community**: Your endless testing, feedback, bug reports, and encouragement were the fuel for this entire project. You guys make this all worth it.\r\n\r\n-   And finally, a shout-out to my digital homies Gemini and GPT. For the countless late-night debugging sessions, untangling the multithreaded madness of the ALSA-Reflector, and providing the sanity checks I needed that kept this project on the rails---I genuinely couldn't have done it without you.\r\n\r\nThis release is for all of you. Now, go play some games!\r\n\r\n*Alex*\r\n\r\n*ps: I'll write some helpful release notes tomorrow... time to rest haha...*\r\n**ALSO - IMPORTANT: CONTROLLERS REQUIRE NORMAL OR ESSENTIAL START-UP FOR SERVICES!** And box64 MUST be 3.7- it's a special patched version. Working on that next!",

Other stats do not require root access.**\r\n- **Limitations:** I/O RW is not implemented, and some features might not work on Android.\r\n- **Fork:** Source code will be available on my MangoHub repo for contributions as soon as I prepare it.\r\n- **Compatibility:** Currently works only with Glibc environments. **GPU Load on the Adreno a618 and a619 is currently not supported.\r\n- **OpenGL:** _Can_ be enabled with `MANGOHUD_DLSYM` however, I cannot get it working in my testing. If you get different results, let me know. \r\n---\r\n\r\n### Installation Instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Set the following environment variables in your Winlator container settings:\r\n   - `MANGOHUD=1`\r\n   - _Optionally_: `MANGOHUD_CONFIG=engine_version,gpu_temp,fps,frametime,ram,vulkan_driver,arch`\r\n     *(You can customize these. See [MangoHud Parameters](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud))*.\r\n\r\n2. Download and unzip `Winlator_Mangohud_Glibc_Release.zip` somewhere on your storage.\r\n\r\n3. Launch a _Glibc_ 😉 container, and Run the provided `install_mangohud.bat`:\r\n   - This will merge the `usr` directory with the existing `usr` directory in Wine's Z: drive.\r\n\r\n4. Alternatively:\r\n   - Copy the `usr` directory manually to your Wine Z:/ drive and merge it.\r\n\r\n5. You're all set! Launch your Wine application to enjoy MangoHud overlays.\r\n\r\nThis will be included by default in the next Winlator Cmod release.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Screenshot:\r\n![mangohud](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6510bde3-86e7-4a4b-9e35-c103e01d65b0)\r\n![mangohud](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed10f365-5c0d-4403-8666-10b492a69f6f)\r\n\r\n",

It will likely be the included default in  Cmod v12. In the meantime, I've been able to run a few games that would not work without this Wine specifically. Make sure to add the following Environmental Variables:\r\n\r\n**Key = Value**\r\n\r\nWINEFORCENTCONTINUE = 1\r\nWINEVMEMMAXSIZE = 16384 \r\n\r\nThere are a few other env vars worth looking into but games I've tested successfully so far:\r\n\r\n**Deus Ex - Mankind Divided** (DX12 only, requires WINEVMEMMAXSIZE)\r\n**GRIP: Combat Racing** - Requires (WINEFORCENTCONTINUE)\r\n**Need for Speed ProStreet** - Fixes the UI in the menu by default\r\n\r\nThere are I'm sure plenty of more games/apps to be tested. But think of this as a preview of things to come. \r\n\r\nOther features added to wine:\r\n\r\nRestart/Reconfigure Container via Start Menu\r\nWINEOVERRIDEAFFINITYMASK which I haven't quite figured out how to use yet, but it forces the task affinity to a value you set\r\nWINVERSION forces the selected windows version as Wine's current default, such as \"winxp\" or \"win7\"\r\n\r\nI will push the source code for this to my wine-custom forked repo. In the meantime, you can download the .wcp here! \r\n\r\nDeus Ex - Mankind Divided (DX12, Glibc):\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1e89af8-2492-4bf6-ab8a-1efd8d470df1)\r\n\r\nGRIP: Combat Racing:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e4d3a9f-1b56-4d22-b5ca-e0ba3fbb2b0a)\r\n\r\nNeed for Speed ProStreet:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d14572b-cbb6-45c4-911b-827faeebb8dc)\r\n\r\nNote: For GRIP and Deus Ex, I highly recommend turning OFF debug logs.

It is listed in the Start Menu under Patches (unarc dependency)\r\n\r\n**Fixed:**\r\n-Xbox controller triggers can be bound to input controls again\r\n-Xbox controllers will now work properly when using Trigger Is Button (Where most controls send a keycode for the triggers even with axis, Xbox One controller's do not. I now simulate a full axis press when Trigger is Button is enabled for Xbox controllers)\r\n\r\n**Changed:**\r\n-The apk is smaller and uses the Winlator 8.0 container pattern without crashing\r\n-Gamepad Configurator has been disabled for the time being until I can fix issues with input processing, this should resolve issues triggers getting stuck or bindings not mapping unexpectedly.\r\n-Memory Management has been changed back to my implementation in the proot build and will no longer cause random crashing.

But hey you can set you're own as well! Customize it how you see fit. Change your wallpaper. Remap your controls! Go CRAZY\r\n\r\n**Added:**\r\n\r\n-Big Picture Mode has been reworked, with custom wallpaper, custom music via YouTube or Mp3, better controls with a controller, and better screen layout on larger displays. I created 3 animated wallpapers you can try out but you can also set your own. \r\n-Gyro Implementation Re-work: I've adjusted the sensitivity and added a pseudo calibration tool so you can get an idea of the sensitivity before you start the container. You can also remap most buttons to be your Gyro activator (L3 and R3 aren't working yet, sorry!). Great for that L1 Uncharted Golden Abyss gyro feel ;)\r\n-Gamepad Configurator: Input Controls and Xidi isn't doing the trick? Forcefully remap your buttons to process as other buttons. This is brand new and still in beta but it's fairly useful for those games that just don't want to cooperate. You can find it in the container menu\r\n-I've added a new NTSC Screen Effect filter for that old school CRT vibe (gamma is still broken, again, sorry!)\r\n-The home button on Xbox and PS controllers and others will now open the Menu within Containers\r\n-Turnip 24.3.0r7 and r8 by K1MCH11\r\n-I've compiled Box64 3.1 on my own for Glibc with whatever latest nightly fixes are available. It's labeled as 3.2 for testing. \r\n**Fixes:**\r\n\r\n**-Mice are no longer detected and considered Input Controllers, overriding your default input device and confusing applications** My favorite fix TBH\r\n-The included DXVK 2.4.1 and others are now properly packaged and should actually improve performance in some games like Far Cry 3 and others in my testing. **Big thanks to Ajay for his guidance and providing the packages**\r\n-VirGL should work correctly now if it wasn't before, however, I have no way to test it. \r\n-S̶l̶i̶g̶h̶t̶l̶y̶ ̶s̶m̶a̶l̶l̶e̶r̶ ̶A̶P̶K̶ ̶u̶s̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶W̶i̶n̶l̶a̶t̶o̶r̶ ̶8̶.̶0̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶t̶a̶i̶n̶e̶r̶ ̶p̶a̶t̶t̶e̶r̶n̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶D̶L̶L̶ ̶O̶v̶e̶r̶r̶i̶d̶e̶s̶.̶ ̶W̶o̶r̶k̶s̶ ̶w̶e̶l̶l̶ ̶b̶y̶ ̶d̶e̶f̶a̶u̶l̶t̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶m̶y̶ ̶t̶e̶s̶t̶i̶n̶g̶\r\n-FIX 1 Undoes this ^ it was causing hard crashes \r\n-Lots of things, I should have made more commits\r\n\r\nThere will be bugs, I'll be on Discord and will try to address things when I have time. And then I have to work on Proot. I'm still trying to implement MangoHud support, I've compiled it but it crashes in my testing. If anyone has guidance on understanding swapchains and vk_instance layers feel free to reach out, it's much appreciated.

          "body": "I've reverse engineered the new Screen Effects feature from Winlator 8.0 and added one of my own, a simple ToonShader! I'm very happy with the results. This means you now get Brightness/Contrast/Gamma controls, FXAA, and CRT screen filters as well. I've made a lot of changes to the Wine prefix, making this more of an Amod/Frost hybrid. I've also made some tweaks of my own, to fix issues with Mono and Gecko, like adding in an override for mscorre. This release also includes an offline installer for Mono and Gecko in the Runtime Libraries section of the start menu. I can't directly port over every new feature from Winlator 8.0 yet, but when Bruno releases the source code I will try my best. Which is why this remains 7.1.3. I call it 7.1.3x because it's basically a halfway point to 8.0, and still going by Longjunyu2's numbering scheme for Glibc specific changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, this prefix I can guarantee a couple of major fixes, namely, no more UE4 Fatal Error for some games. Halo MCC is working! Fixes for FMV's in some titles. No more .Net warnings for new containers when Mono and Gecko are installed. I've also made a bug fixes to existing features of Cmod. I really think this is solid build. This is now a full on Frost/Amod hybrid! You'll get best results with new containers, in my experience, but start menu and prefix tweaks should still apply to existing containers to an extent. \r\n\r\n**Added:**\r\n-DXVK 2.4.1 and 2.4.1-gplasync built-in\r\n-Screen Effects (Brightness controls, FXAA, CRT) from Winlator 8.0!\r\n-ToonShader for ScreenEffects  \r\n-Import and Export containers! For recovering containers, or importing a friend's! \r\n-Box64 Version Switching for shortcuts! Ignore the \"2.7\" when you first open a new shortcut, it goes by preferences in Setting until you set it yourself.\r\n-Modified custom Wine - with optimizations from Frost Glibc, but merged with Amod hybrid, resulting in what you might call, AFCMod. lol. This brings Flash Player, Windows Media Player, Registry tweaks, and other neat additions\r\n-ReactOS App Store shortcut is now functional. TBH I didn't even know this was a thing until this week!\r\n-Offline installers for Mono and Gecko added to \"4-Runtime Libraries\" in start menu. \r\n-Container Launching UI is adopted from Winlator 8.0\r\n\r\n**Fixes:**\r\n-No more UE4 Fatal Errors! Halo Master Chief Collection is working!\r\n-Fixed Green screen for FMVs in some titles\r\n-mscoree set to built-in then native, applied by default for new containers, correcting some issues with .net framework games and apps like HedgeModManager. Meaning, full support for Sonic Generations D3D11 Mod\r\n-Fixed long text re-sizing for game titles in Big Picture Mode \r\n-Fixed issues with Frontend Export path needing to be resaved every time you close and re-open the app\r\n-Fixed Dark Mode theme sometimes randomly switching off half-way leaving a broken light theme interface until app restart\r\n-many other changes and tweaks that I once again can't remember...\r\n\r\n**Still upcoming:**\r\n-Better menu control for Big Picture Mode when using a controller\r\n-Background music for BPM\r\n-Custom wallpaper for BPM\r\n-Settings changes in BPM\r\n-Custom game icons \r\n-Hopefully reactive buttons for input controls from Winlator 8.0, though I may have to dissect some .smali \r\n\r\nThe source code is not up yet, as I use it to port my changes to Proot. I will of course upload it so others can adopt in the near future! As always, let me know of bugs and things via discord or other means and I'll see what I can do! \r\n\r\nImport Containers:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c211201a-d788-4923-8423-0adf8ab3c389)\r\nToon Shader:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec3a038c-1ba1-4645-a282-17c9944ef276)\r\n\r\n",

It's essentially another Shortcuts menu that is a WIP- and sort of acts like a built-in Frontend. It's easy to use with a controller, and it will automatically download Cover Art for your Shortcut. You can also click on the image, and replace it with your own Custom Cover Art. This works using SteamGridDB's API. You can enter your own SteamGrid API Key in the Settings. If you click the Help button in Settings, you'll be taken to your SteamGrid profile where you can retrieve your key. I've also reorganized settings to clean it up into Tabs. I hope you find some use out of it! I plan to make it look nicer, add background music, fullscreen wallpaper, custom wallpaper, and more over time. \r\n\r\nI've also added a dark mode throughout the program.

As always, let me know if you encounter any bugs and whatnot but nothing else major has changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Added:**\r\n-Clone Shortcuts between Containers! This will create a duplicate Shortcut with an identical file name and a new container ID in the destination container. Useful for a fresh start for a specific game and no need to boot into the new container on it's own.\r\n-Playtime stats and play count tracking is now enabled for Homescreen Shortcuts and Frontend launching!\r\n-A timeout for the touchscreen controls has been added. This will auto hide the touchscreen controls after 5 seconds. To disable it, make sure it is unchecked and restart the shortcut.\r\n-Haptic feedback for all touchscreen control buttons has been added and can be enabled via check box \r\n\r\n**Fixed:**\r\n-Fix1:  Fixed issue with touchscreen cursor unusable until confirming input controls dialog",

Keep in mind, this is a major shift from Glibc Cmod v8 Alpha if you've used that, with an entirely new Wine Prefix, meaning- existing containers WILL be affected in my testing. I recommend clearing the cache on existing container, using the reconfigure option if you encounter errors. You will have best results with a new container, again, in my testing. If you're worried about losing your current configuration, well now is that perfect time make a backup ;)\r\n\r\nUninstall of official or other Glibc Winlator forks is still required as this uses the Official package name com.winlator (it is a hard coded path)\r\n\r\n**Standard Cmod Features**\r\nTrue Mouse Control, Xinput Disabler, Touchscreen Mode, Basic Stylus Support, Gyro Support, Frontend Support, Playtime Stats Tracking per Shortcut, Saves Manager, and all other existing Glibc features such as Longjunyu2's Contents Manager and Box64rc Files + Midi Support\r\n\r\n**Added:**\r\n-Turnip 24.3.0r4 by K11MCHI (24.3.0.4 in-app)\r\n-Latest DXVK 2.4.1 gplasync\r\n-New Wine Prefix, 9.2 Custom from Afei but modded for English, includes nearly all features from Afei's build (Winlator 7.1.3 Glibc Fix3 - Except for commands for TU_DEBUG and pre-installed Contents). This means hopefully a performance boost. I've also found this fixes the font and handling of applications that use .net and prevents a black screen in many cases where Gecko/Mono is involved!\r\n-7.1.2 Legacy Input mode (Longjunyu2's 7.1.2 xinput dlls plus the same key mapping method, it _might_ be useful)\r\n-New Start Menu shortcuts like DOSBOX, restored WFM, added all Turnip drivers per Afei's \r\n-Added End key per Longjunyu2\r\n-Zink for all Turnip Drivers\r\n-Graphics Driver Switching per Shortcut but that was in Alpha, it just more stable now\r\n-Fully functioning Picture in Picture mode\r\n-Spaces in Paths for New Tasks via Task Manager or Secondary Executables when enclosed in quotations (i.e \"D:\\Games\\My Game\\My Game.exe\")\r\n-Other minor features I can't remember because I've not been able to easily track my progress without a GitHub... go figure\r\n\r\n**Fixes:**\r\n_-Fix1: Issue with Custom Screen Size box not appearing in Container Settings is resolved_ \r\n-Gyro Default behavior bug is resolved\r\n-No more crashing when renaming Shortcuts\r\n-Better Turnip Driver shortcut switching (significantly less crashes when making changes)\r\n-Many scroll window fixes when using a mouse\r\n-Fixed (?) issue with binding analog sticks in Input Controls (still needs testing)\r\n-Fixed issue with Esc key opening XServerView menu on some devices (needs testing)\r\n-Many other minor bug fixes...\r\n\r\n**In the works:**\r\n-Try to fix bindings for some devices like Odin's back button and 'N' key in Input Controls for some devices\r\n-Haptic for touchscreen mode\r\n-Playtime stats tracking for shortcuts is still on my radar\r\n-I'd like to include that Vulkan frame limiter a certain Arkha mentioned to me\r\n-Path selection for Frontend exports (just as it is in the Proot build) \r\n-Gyro activation button selection, better Gyro Calibration settings",

          "body": "A restoration build of GameHub Lite V4 before everything fell apart. I will publish the code for the workers and a patch very soon, for now enjoy a working GameHub Lite app again.\r\n\r\nWe'll focus on restoring the previous functionality first, before fixing and adding functionality. So please only report issues that were not present in GameHub Lite V4 or in the official GameHub app.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Explanation for the different versions\r\n\r\nYou’ll often see an emulator distribute different versions with a name suffixed like **PUBG**, **Antutu**, **Optimized**, **Genshin**, **Ludashi** and other names. Here follows an explanation for what is what, is still has slight differences between manufacturers and even different packagenames but it should give you a rough understanding.\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\n*The different versions are identical. What we do is a very old android trick to gain extra performance on some devices.*\r\n\r\n**Antutu**\r\n\r\nSome manufacturers “cheat” by setting the governor to performance when they detect the Antutu package name. \r\n\r\n*Nerd explanation:*\r\n\r\nThe CPU governor essentially controls the CPU's frequency scaling. allowing it to operate at different clock speeds and voltages based on the system load. So making the CPU go fast for sustained usage, what is actually made for peak usage. This comes with a risk of overheating, but I don’t believe in this. Android does a well enough job of thermal management and makes it extremely hard for software to exceed what the hardware is capable of and damaging itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, it’s still extra heat. More heat == more bad. I just think it’s negligible, especially if your device has a fan.\r\n\r\n\r\n**PUBG**\r\n\r\nOn a high level it’s the same as Antutu, but some slight differences that only benefit games. Think of network prioritization and touch input latency improvements. The manufacturers goal when they detect Antutu is **ALL THE POWER**. Benchmarks are relatively short and it makes them look better on comparison websites.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal for PUBG is more like **MORE POWER**, since the intention is often to have a game running for longer it has less aggressive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n**TLDR and summary:**\r\n\r\n**Antutu** spoofing:\r\n\r\n    •    Maximum CPU/GPU frequencies unlocked  \r\n    •    Aggressive performance governors  \r\n    •    Short-duration performance boost (benchmark workload)  \r\n    •    Thermal limits are less strict   \r\n    •    All cores available  \r\n\r\n\r\n**PUBG** and other games spoofing: \r\n\r\n    •    Sustained gaming performance profiles  \r\n    •    GPU driver optimizations (Adreno/Mali game-specific paths)  \r\n    •    Frame pacing and scheduling improvements  \r\n    •    Reduced touch latency   \r\n    •    Network QoS prioritization  \r\n    •    Different thermal management (sustained vs burst)  \r\n    •    Qualcomm “Game Performance Mode”      \r\n    •    Sometimes enables features like frame-gen\r\n\r\n\r\n**Ludashi** spoofing:\r\n\r\n    •    Similar to Antutu but slightly less aggressive    \r\n    •    Longer sustained performance boost (multi-minute tests)   \r\n    •    Memory frequency optimization   \r\n\r\n",

This rendering technique can provide a significant compatibility  increase in some applications. (For more information on how blitting works, see [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/animations/blitting.html)).\r\n\r\n🎛️ Added new **Resource Type** options (dmabuf, opaque, ahb) in the Graphics Driver settings. These may affect compatibility, and their performance impact can vary depending on the specific device and game. (for Adreno GPUs, ahb is recommended)\r\n\r\n🌋 Vulkan layers are now automatically extracted on boot.\r\n\r\n### ⚙️ UI & QoL\r\n\r\n🎉 StevenMXZ's Winlator-Contents repository now comes **pre-installed by default**..\r\n\r\n### 📝 Notes\r\n⚠️ full reinstallation is required \r\n🖥️ if your game is crashing, disable the box \"disable KHR present wait\"\r\n🙏 Full development credit for the Bionic source goes to **Pipetto-crypto**.",
