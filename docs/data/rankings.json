This is the most stable experience, but may lack in performance compared to any of the following alternatives.\r\n- **GCC**: The standard GNU compiler; this is the default for Linux and will provide the most stable experience.\r\n- **PGO**: These are built with Clang, and use PGO. PGO (profile-guided optimization) uses data from prior compilations\r\n\tto determine the \"hotspots\" found within the codebase. Using these hotspots,\r\n\tit can allocate more resources towards these heavily-used areas, and thus generally see improved performance to the tune of ~10-50%,\r\n\tdepending on the specific game, hardware, and platform.

This is the most stable experience, but may lack in performance compared to any of the following alternatives.\r\n- **GCC**: The standard GNU compiler; this is the default for Linux and will provide the most stable experience.\r\n- **PGO**: These are built with Clang, and use PGO. PGO (profile-guided optimization) uses data from prior compilations\r\n\tto determine the \"hotspots\" found within the codebase.

          "body": "## Changelog\r\n\r\nThis is the stable release for v0.1.0. This release contains some UI improvements, regression fixes, and more of the usual performance and graphical improvements.\r\n\r\nAs always, this list is not comprehensive, and we encourage you to read [the full changelog](https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden/compare/v0.0.4...v0.1.0).\r\n\r\n**If you face any spurious visual glitches that don't seem right, remember to wipe your shader cache.**\r\n\r\n## Universal\r\n\r\n- Significantly reduced memory synchronization and DMA operation overhead\r\n  * With Sync Memory Operations enabled, users may now see a performance boost, depending on their specific setup.\r\n  * Games that rely heavily on DMA operations see significant performance boosts.\r\n  * This mostly affects desktop targets, but Android may see some improved performance as well.\r\n- Implemented the News page to show news for our releases\r\n- Improved shader compilation speed on lower-end systems\r\n- Fixed performance regressions in Luigi's Mansion 3\r\n  * As part of this change, it was noted that Fast GPU Time on 128 was actually causing significant performance loss on many games. As such, this option has been removed, and now only 256 and 512 are available.\r\n- Reworked certain setting's presentation\r\n  * Several options that had a toggle have been changed to have an explicit \"Off\" or \"Normal\" setting instead.\r\n  * ExtendedDynamicState is now a selection box on all platforms, rather than a slider.\r\n  * Web username and token now have default values\r\n- Optimized dummy thread storage\r\n  * This reduces CPU usage and improves 1/0.1% lows slightly.\r\n- GetSystemInfo has been implemented\r\n  * This makes Eden behave closer to a real Switch, meaning certain mods that attempt to disable themselves on Yuzu-based emulators may now work properly.\r\n- Added stubs for firmware 21.1.0\r\n  * Some newer games that require 21+ may see improvements from this.\r\n- Improved JIT performance on devices with higher memory\r\n- Added GPU-accelerated texture unswizzling options\r\n  * Notably, this improves graphical bugs in Metroid Prime 4.\r\n- Allow skipping player selection on certain games that forcefully select another user\r\n  * Notably, this makes certain Alien Hominid and certain Jackbox packs playable without creating multiple users.\r\n- Added a toggle to remove bloom and blur effects from certain games\r\n  * Notably, this affects Burnout and the chibi-style Zelda games.\r\n- Implemented game title sorting\r\n- Replaced the default gray profile picture with the Eden logo\r\n- Reduced core memory overhead\r\n- Fixed Jackbox and other games that require an internet connection\r\n- Fixed memory allocation and some graphics bugs in Marvel: Cosmic Invasion\r\n- Fixed audio issues in Metroid Prime 4\r\n- Fixed audio mute not fully muting sounds\r\n- Fixed Ender Magnolia crashing on older CPUs\r\n- Fixed microphone input\r\n- Fixed the `+ Options` menu on Qlaunch\r\n- Fixed an occasional save issue with Absolum on Cyrillic languages\r\n\r\n## Renderer\r\n\r\n- ExtendedDynamicState and other extensions have been completely reworked\r\n  * If games didn't work properly before with ExtendedDynamicState or similar, try again.\r\n- Improved flickering in several problematic games\r\n- Fixed some graphics-related performance issues in Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition and Pokemon Scarlet/Violet\r\n- Fixed some issues with older CPUs that lack certain vectorization instructions\r\n- Improved resource usage on Android GPUs\r\n- Improved cache hit rate and reduced CPU overhead during GPU processing\r\n  * Notably, this reduces the amount of time it takes for graphical performance to stabilize.\r\n- Improved rendering on stock Qualcomm drivers\r\n  * Notably, some bugs have been fixed on Link's Awakening, Pokemon Scarlet/Violet, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.\r\n  * This affects both Android and Windows on ARM laptops.\r\n- Fixed flickering and odd texture artifacts at 1x resolution\r\n  * Notably, this improves games like Luigi's Mansion 3.\r\n- Fixed occasional bugs where MK8DX and others could randomly explode into a slurry of colors, or have intermittent flickering.\r\n  \r\n## Desktop\r\n\r\n- The Graphics submenu has been reorganized\r\n- You can now change the location of save data\r\n- The Discord RPC implementation now shows the current game in the main status instead of just \"Eden\"\r\n- Fix an issue where more than 4 controllers couldn't connect at once\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n\r\n- Added a page to change some Turnip driver settings\r\n  * This only affects open-source Adreno drivers.\r\n- Fixed some UI bugs with the game list\r\n  * Changing device rotation could cause temporary misalignments\r\n  * Gamepad navigation was very finicky and sometimes nonfunctional\r\n- Fixed an app crash caused by overlay auto-hide\r\n- Fixed cases where the overlay could cause the touchscreen to be disabled temporarily\r\n- Ported custom path settings from desktop\r\n- Added a Quick Settings menu on the right of the screen during emulation\r\n- Added an option to disable automatic BCn driver patching for Adreno\r\n  * This patch operation can cause crashes on really old systems.\r\n- Fixed some miscellaneous crashing issues that affect Turnip but not stock Adreno drivers\r\n\r\n## Internal\r\n\r\n- Some log spam has been reduced\r\n- `YUZU_USE_BUNDLED_QT` has been reworked, and the bundled Qt is now fully static on Windows and MacOS.\r\n  * Usage on Linux outside of CI is not recommended, and this bundled Qt does not support WebEngine.\r\n- For packagers: `YUZU_ENABLE_LTO` is now just `ENABLE_LTO`, and `YUZU_USE_FASTER_LD` is now `USE_FASTER_LINKER`.\r\n\r\n# Packages\r\n\r\n## Targets\r\n\r\nEach build is optimized for a specific architecture and uses a specific compiler.\r\n\r\n- **aarch64/arm64**: For devices that use the armv8-a instruction set; e.g. Snapdragon X, all Android devices, and Apple Silicon Macs.\r\n- **amd64**: For devices that use the amd64 (aka x86_64) instruction set; this is exclusively used by Intel and AMD CPUs and is only found on desktops.\r\n\r\n**Compilers**\r\n\r\n- **MSVC**: The default compiler for Windows. This is the most stable experience, but may lack in performance compared to any of the following alternatives.\r\n- **GCC**: The standard GNU compiler; this is the default for Linux and will provide the most stable experience.\r\n- **PGO**: These are built with Clang, and use PGO. PGO (profile-guided optimization) uses data from prior compilations\r\n\tto determine the \"hotspots\" found within the codebase. Using these hotspots,\r\n\tit can allocate more resources towards these heavily-used areas, and thus generally see improved performance to the tune of ~10-50%,\r\n\tdepending on the specific game, hardware, and platform. Do note that additional instabilities may occur.\r\n\r\n## Linux\r\n\r\nLinux packages are distributed via AppImage.\r\n[zsync](https://zsync.moria.org.uk/) files are provided for easier updating, such as via\r\n[AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM).\r\n\r\n| Build Type | GCC | PGO | Notes |\r\n|------------|-----|-----|-------|\r\n| amd64 | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-amd64-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-amd64-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-amd64-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-amd64-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| \r\n| Legacy amd64 | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-legacy-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-legacy-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-legacy-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-legacy-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| Pre-Ryzen or Haswell CPUs (expect sadness)\r\n| Steam Deck | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-steamdeck-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-steamdeck-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-steamdeck-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-steamdeck-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| Zen 2, with additional patches for SteamOS\r\n| ROG Ally X | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-rog-ally-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-rog-ally-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-rog-ally-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-rog-ally-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| Zen 4\r\n| aarch64 | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-aarch64-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-aarch64-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-aarch64-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Linux-v0.1.0-aarch64-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| \r\n\r\n## Debian/Ubuntu\r\n\r\nDebian/Ubuntu targets are `.deb` files, which can be installed via `sudo dpkg -i <package>.deb`.\r\n\r\n| Target | amd64 | aarch64 | Notes |\r\n|--------|-------|---------|-------|\r\n| Ubuntu 24.04 | [amd64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Ubuntu-24.04-v0.1.0-amd64.deb) | [aarch64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Ubuntu-24.04-v0.1.0-aarch64.deb) | Not compatible with Ubuntu 25.04 or later\r\n| Debian 12 | [amd64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Debian-12-v0.1.0-amd64.deb) | [aarch64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Debian-12-v0.1.0-aarch64.deb) | Drivers may be old\r\n| Debian 13 | [amd64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Debian-13-v0.1.0-amd64.deb) | [aarch64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.1.0/Eden-Debian-13-v0.1.0-aarch64.deb) | \r\n\r\n## Windows\r\n\r\nWindows packages are in-place zip files.

We hope to offer users a more stable experience with this new release candidate.\r\n\r\nAs always, clear your shader caches as the vulkan pipeline parameters continues to change.\r\n\r\n## Critical\r\n- Experimental support for firmware versions 21.x is now available.\r\n  * Most software applets work as expected, but like 20.x, the home menu is currently missing game icons.\r\n\r\n## Universal\r\n- Reduce SPSC/MPSC queue contention, increases performance for various games\r\n  * Mileage may vary, on tested hardware games could get up to 10 FPS extra\r\n- Translations have been updated\r\n- Fixed performance regressions (stuttering) found in Tears of the Kingdom\r\n\r\n## Renderer\r\n- Fix SURED() having inappropriate behaviour for certain decoding fields\r\n- Fixed Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound black screen during the 4-1 boss fight.\r\n- Improved Pokemon: Legends Z-A graphical bugs\r\n  * Enabling Extended Dynamic State and disabling Vertex Input Dynamic State is recommended to avoid vertex explosions.\r\n  * Flickering and invisible objects may still be present.\r\n- Fixed flipped screen in 20xx\r\n\r\n## Desktop\r\n- Working MinGW (Windows) builds for arm64 are now available.\r\n  * This primarily targets Snapdragon X laptops.\r\n- Fixed several issues with Ryujinx save data linking.\r\n  * Attempting a \"From Eden\" link and saving on Ryujinx would destroy the link.\r\n  * Windows would often fail to create a link at all, especially if the path contained spaces.\r\n  * Prior link detection was unreliable.\r\n- Fixed several issues with the orphaned profile detector.\r\n  * A bunch of extra zeroes would appear in the \"good\" profiles list\r\n  * Automatically-created profiles for games like Smash Ultimate and Factorio were included in the \"bad\" profile list.\r\n- Fixed a bug on POSIX where the app would immediately crash in scenarios where `USER` was unset.\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n- Fixes crashes on Ender Magnolia and UE4 games introduced by defered allocations\r\n  - UE4 games should be more stable\r\n- Remove ScopedJitExecutor; fixes crashes in Assasins Creed 3\r\n  - Scoped JIT sucks and will hopefully never be brought up ever again\r\n- Custom CPU Ticks can now have its value typed in manually.\r\n- Setting to manually set app language\r\n- Fixed carousel view occasionally clipping out of the bottom of the screen.\r\n- Added a system information dialog\r\n  * Contains CPU, GPU, system, etc. info\r\n- Shader cache is now wiped whenever the GPU driver is changed.\r\n\r\n## Internal\r\n\r\n- MinGW and macOS builds are now fully static.\r\n  * macOS now only contains its MoltenVK dependency, whereas MinGW builds are self-contained executables.\r\n- Fix FFmpeg annoyances for Solaris and BSD\r\n- Reduce code duplication on shader_recompiler\r\n- Provide fallbacks for platforms without atomic 128 bit swaps\r\n- Fix formatting for big endian targets\r\n\r\n## Builds\r\n\r\nMSVC/arm64 builds have been retired, and replaced with MinGW/arm64 builds. Additionally, all MSVC PGO builds have been removed due to a lack of performance gain, and are replaced by MinGW PGO builds.\r\n\r\n## TL;DR\r\n\r\nAgain these changelogs aren't that long, but for the sake of briefness:\r\n\r\n- Fixes for Pokemon ZA on AMD\r\n- Fixes for Ender Magnolia on Android and other UE4 games\r\n- Fixes for regressions from 0.0.4-rc1 and 0.0.4-rc2\r\n- Initial Firmware 21 support\r\n- Windows on ARM support\r\n\r\n# Packages\r\n\r\nAndroid Antutu builds can be found [here](https://github.com/Bixbr/eden-ci/releases/tag/v0.0.4-rc3).\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nLinux packages are distributed via AppImage.\r\n[zsync](https://zsync.moria.org.uk/) files are provided for easier updating, such as via\r\n[AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM).\r\n\r\n| Build Type | GCC | PGO | Notes |\r\n|------------|-----|-----|-------|\r\n| amd64 | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-amd64-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-amd64-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-amd64-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-amd64-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| \r\n| Legacy amd64 | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-legacy-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-legacy-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-legacy-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-legacy-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| Pre-Ryzen or Haswell CPUs (expect sadness)\r\n| Steam Deck | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-steamdeck-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-steamdeck-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-steamdeck-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-steamdeck-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| Zen 2, with additional patches for SteamOS\r\n| ROG Ally X | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-rog-ally-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-rog-ally-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-rog-ally-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-rog-ally-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| Zen 4\r\n| aarch64 | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-aarch64-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-aarch64-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-aarch64-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc3-aarch64-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| \r\n\r\n### Debian/Ubuntu\r\n\r\nDebian/Ubuntu targets are `.deb` files, which can be installed via `sudo dpkg -i <package>.deb`.\r\n\r\n| Target | amd64 | aarch64 | Notes |\r\n|--------|-------|---------|-------|\r\n| Ubuntu 24.04 | [amd64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Ubuntu-24.04-v0.0.4-rc3-amd64.deb) | [aarch64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Ubuntu-24.04-v0.0.4-rc3-aarch64.deb) | Not compatible with Ubuntu 25.04 or later\r\n| Debian 12 | [amd64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Debian-12-v0.0.4-rc3-amd64.deb) | [aarch64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Debian-12-v0.0.4-rc3-aarch64.deb) | Drivers may be old\r\n| Debian 13 | [amd64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Debian-13-v0.0.4-rc3-amd64.deb) | [aarch64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc3/Eden-Debian-13-v0.0.4-rc3-aarch64.deb) | \r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nWindows packages are in-place zip files.

The issue was related to vtable handling being improperly typecasted from a pointer-to-pointer to a pointer.\r\n\r\nAlso you can now play CTGPDX and stuff since ASLR is also now implemented properly, should fix a bunch of skyline mods as well.\r\n\r\n*The NVIDIA vertex explosions and AMD fixes for Pokemon ZA are not in this release, please be patient <3*\r\n\r\nThis release also fixes a lot of bugs related to Ryujinx save linking, as always **back up your saves!**\r\n\r\n### Universal\r\n- Skyline compatibility, minimal ASLR implementation.\r\n- Support for VTable bouncing.\r\n - Should fix crashes in Pokemon ZA.\r\n- Dynarmic internal refactorings to reduce code latency.\r\n - This should decrease loading times and stutters by a tiny margin.\r\n- Do not immediately error out if OpenGL is missing some extensions (meant for older cards).\r\n - There may be visual glitches.\r\n- Fix a regression found on image_view and image_view_info.\r\n- Windows 8.1 support (command line only).\r\n- More verbose backtraces.\r\n\r\n### Renderer\r\n- Maxwell translator loop now uses a tighter logic without dynamic dispatchers.\r\n - Just let the compiler do it's thing.\r\n- Add IAbs64 support to prevent IR errors.\r\n - It fixes an obscure behaviour very few programs rely on.\r\n- Add back VIDS but disable on EDS0\r\n- Increase MAX_MIP_LEVELS to 16 to match spec.\r\n\r\n### Desktop\r\n- Audio fixes for steamdeck.\r\n- Clean up orphaned profiles bugs.\r\n- Added an option to force X11 backend for Linux users.\r\n- Discord RPC no longer uses named variant logo.\r\n- Moved links to the \"About\" section.\r\n- Add `vpushfb` usage in Dynarmic for VREV32/64.\r\n- Move save option location in the data manager tool.\r\n- Fixes for NixOS and DragonFlyBSD.\r\n- Removed QDockWidget Wait Tree.\r\n\r\n### Android\r\n- Various UX fixups and improvments.\r\n- Fix rotate and unpause bug.\r\n- Fixes for QLaunch.\r\n\r\n### Internal\r\n- Removed software prefetching instances.\r\n- Fix audio reverb according to spec.\r\n- Stub ReleaseSleepLock and ReleaseSleepLockTransiently.\r\n- Some general code cleanups.\r\n- Removed Zydis/Zycore.\r\n - This should reduce executable size by a bit.\r\n- More things translated from `Common::` into `std::`.\r\n- Fixes for Intel Atom N455.\r\n\r\n### TLDR\r\n\r\n**You didn't read the changelog in full? Unfortunate - because it was a bit shorter this time :)**\r\n\r\n- Fixed a critical bug for all x86_64 Linux users (didn't affect FreeBSD or Solaris)\r\n- Slight performance increases for shader compilation\r\n- DragonFlyBSD support ruh rah!\r\n- Fixes for audio cutoffs on steamdeck.\r\n\r\n# Packages\r\n\r\n## Targets\r\n\r\n[For more specialized Android builds, Antutu and stuff](https://github.com/Bixbr/eden-ci/releases/tag/v0.0.4-rc2)\r\n\r\nEach build is optimized for a specific architecture and uses a specific compiler.\r\n\r\n- **aarch64/arm64**: For devices that use the armv8-a instruction set; e.g. Snapdragon X, all Android devices, and Apple Silicon Macs.\r\n- **amd64**: For devices that use the amd64 (aka x86_64) instruction set; this is exclusively used by Intel and AMD CPUs and is only found on desktops.\r\n\r\n**Compilers**\r\n\r\n- **MSVC**: The default compiler for Windows. This is the most stable experience, but may lack in performance compared to any of the following alternatives.\r\n- **Clang**: An alternative compiler that provides theoretically higher performance, but may have additional graphical glitches.\r\n- **GCC**: The standard GNU compiler; this is the default for Linux and will provide the most stable experience.\r\n- **PGO**: These are built with Clang, and use PGO:\r\n\r\nPGO (profile-guided optimization) uses data from prior compilations to determine the \"hotspots\" found within the codebase. Using these hotspots,\r\nit can allocate more resources towards these heavily-used areas, and thus generally see improved performance to the tune of ~10-50%,\r\ndepending on the specific game, hardware, and platform. Do note that additional instabilities may occur.\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nLinux packages are distributed via AppImage.\r\n[zsync](https://zsync.moria.org.uk/) files are provided for easier updating.\r\n\r\n| Build Type | GCC | PGO | Notes |\r\n|------------|-----|-----|-------|\r\n| amd64 | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-amd64-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-amd64-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-amd64-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-amd64-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| \r\n| Legacy amd64 | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-legacy-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-legacy-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-legacy-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-legacy-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| Pre-Ryzen or Haswell CPUs (expect sadness)\r\n| Steam Deck | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-steamdeck-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-steamdeck-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-steamdeck-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-steamdeck-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| Zen 2, with additional patches for SteamOS\r\n| ROG Ally X | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-rog-ally-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-rog-ally-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-rog-ally-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-rog-ally-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| Zen 4\r\n| aarch64 | [GCC](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-aarch64-gcc-standard.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-aarch64-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | [PGO](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-aarch64-clang-pgo.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc2-aarch64-clang-pgo.AppImage.zsync))| \r\n\r\n### Debian/Ubuntu\r\n\r\nDebian/Ubuntu targets are `.deb` files, which can be installed via `sudo dpkg -i <package>.deb`.\r\n\r\n| Target | amd64 | aarch64 | Notes |\r\n|--------|-------|---------|-------|\r\n| Ubuntu 24.04 | [amd64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Ubuntu-24.04-v0.0.4-rc2-amd64.deb) | [aarch64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Ubuntu-24.04-v0.0.4-rc2-aarch64.deb) | Not compatible with Ubuntu 25.04 or later\r\n| Debian 12 | [amd64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Debian-12-v0.0.4-rc2-amd64.deb) | [aarch64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Debian-12-v0.0.4-rc2-aarch64.deb) | Drivers may be old\r\n| Debian 13 | [amd64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Debian-13-v0.0.4-rc2-amd64.deb) | [aarch64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc2/Eden-Debian-13-v0.0.4-rc2-aarch64.deb) | \r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nWindows packages are in-place zip files.

          "body": "## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Critical\r\n\r\nA bug fix in v0.0.4-rc1 related to improper handling of profiles may result in you losing save data if you're not careful. Read the following very carefully:\r\n\r\nIf your NAND directory is configured to be anywhere other than the default, there is a good chance you will receive a dialog about orphaned profiles. To solve this:\r\n- Take note of what profiles are orphaned\r\n- Backup ALL your save data\r\n- Find the largest and most recently-updated profile folder\r\n- Delete all profiles, but leave any that the dialog told you were VALID\r\n- Copy your \"good\" saves to the good profile (it should NOT be all zeroes)\r\n- If some of your saves are missing, try other old profile folders.\r\n\r\n### Universal\r\n\r\n- Full REV12/REV15 support, and HID support for new games and updates\r\n  * Notably, this allows for many new updates like TotK 1.4.2, BotW 1.8.2, and others to run.\r\n  * This also fixes controller-related bugs in some newer games.\r\n- Initial support for firmware 20.x\r\n  * Some minor issues may still occur, especially in the Home Menu applet. Always keep a backup of a firmware dump from 19.0.1 or earlier just in case.\r\n  * Notably, game icons may not show up in the home menu.\r\n- Fixed save/mod data loading from the Home Menu applet\r\n- Removed the NCA verification bypass\r\n  * Games/updates that previously required NCA verification disabled will now work out of the box.\r\n- Reduced memory mapping latency on Linux and Android\r\n- Optimized texture pass during shader recompilation\r\n- Fixed FIFA FC26 launch\r\n- New window adaptation filters are available: Lanczos, Spline-1, Zero-Tangent, B-Spline, Mitchell, and MMPX\r\n  * For more information, see the [User handbook](https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden/src/branch/master/docs/user/Graphics.md#filters)\r\n- Merged Dynarmic optimization passes into a single TU\r\n- Improved async shader building\r\n  * Graphical glitches caused by this option, notably in Tears of the Kingdom, should be reduced.\r\n- Unstubbed process winding services\r\n  * This fixes applets on firmware 20.x, alongside Bioshock Infinite.\r\n- Many settings have had their verbiage updated and clarity improved\r\n- Fixed audio glitches in Echoes of Wisdom\r\n- Improved CPU/GPU video decoding detection, and better error handling thereof\r\n- Fixed stutters/freezes during certain FMV scenes\r\n  * Notably, this improves Super Mario Galaxy 1/2\r\n- 1.25x resolution option\r\n- Fixed crashes caused by improper controller detection\r\n- Improved game decryption performance\r\n  * This has been shown to significantly reduce startup times, especially with lots of mods installed.\r\n  * On Android, some games now launch ~2x faster.\r\n- Translations for many languages have been dramatically improved and updated.\r\n  * If you wish to translate, go to our [Transifex page](https://app.transifex.com/edenemu/eden-emulator)\r\n- Cheats can now be done *without* build IDs, like Ryujinx\r\n  * Keep in mind that this will not allow for build ID matching, which may cause issues with game updates.\r\n- Reduced Dynarmic code bloat\r\n- Fixed BotW missing audio\r\n  \r\n## Renderer\r\n\r\n- Improved Vulkan memory allocation\r\n  * This should moderately increase R/W speed of Vulkan-allocated memory\r\n- VRAM usage now works properly on integrated graphics\r\n- Fixed crashes in Fire Emblem: Engage and others caused by MSAA handling\r\n- Improved the fast buffer binding path \r\n  * This fixes some flickering in games such as Kirby Star Allies\r\n- Fixed some memory leaks present in the shader compiler\r\n- Present buffers are now properly flushed after CPU work is done on them\r\n- Improved Vulkan spec compliance\r\n  * These *may* improve some graphical bugs on stock Android drivers, but are moreso done for code correctness\r\n  * Shader read barriers\r\n- Ring Buffers\r\n  * This primarily avoids conflicts between the CPU and GPU, and may improve performance\r\n- Fixed RAII, and removed the option for such\r\n- Faster uniform buffers\r\n  * This mitigates some memory errors in TotK and other games\r\n- Improved renderer error messages\r\n- Improved some edge cases where games like Echoes of Wisdom would have undefined rendering behavior\r\n\r\n## Desktop\r\n\r\n- Data Manager\r\n  * Shows how much space is taken up by several commonly-used directories\r\n  * These directories can be cleared, imported, or exported, and are theoretically compatible with Android's import/export system.\r\n- Fixed \"Open Save Data Location\" putting you in the completely wrong folder\r\n  * Due to the nature of this fix, profiles may now be mangled and incorrect. See the note at the top of the changelog for what to do.\r\n- Orphaned profiles finder\r\n  * Save data that is not associated with a specific profile is considered \"orphaned\" as it is effectively inaccessible.\r\n- Ryujinx save data linking\r\n  * This allows users to share save data for specific titles between Eden and Ryujinx.\r\n  * This feature is still in testing, especially on Windows.\r\n- FFmpeg was updated to version 8.0\r\n- Fixed some weirdness with the web applet setting\r\n- Play Time editing\r\n- Fixed misalignments on certain combo boxes (e.g. audio device) on the default theme\r\n- The compatibility list is back (though shortened)\r\n- Fixed the \"Link\" option during migration on Windows\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n\r\n- Improved stock Qualcomm driver compatibility\r\n  * This initial support also improves overall game support on 8 Elite devices.\r\n  * Future releases will expand upon this.\r\n- Compact grid view option\r\n- Fixed some occasional crashes/bugs related to the EmuReady intent and overlay\r\n- The APK is now 16kb-aligned\r\n- Foreground notification service\r\n  * This helps keep the app alive when switching to other activities\r\n- Individual buttons can now be scaled on the overlay\r\n- The overlay can now auto-hide when it hasn't been used for some time\r\n- Android versions as low as Android 7 are now supported\r\n  * Note that your device still MUST support Vulkan 1.1, and should meet the [minimum requirements](https://eden-emu.dev/noscript/compatibility.html) for processing power.\r\n- Mouse/keyboard support\r\n- Per-game configuration import, export, and sharing\r\n- Added play time features from the Desktop frontend\r\n- Certain unneeded popups and warnings have been removed\r\n- Added the update checker from the Desktop frontend\r\n- (experimental) Amiibo support\r\n- Ability to filter logs to only include useful errors and warnings, rather than useless information\r\n\r\n## Internal\r\n\r\n- Compatibility improvements for *BSD, Solaris, macOS, HaikuOS, and many more\r\n  * NetBSD and DragonFlyBSD are now partially supported\r\n- LTO has been improved to utilize IPO (interprocedural optimization), aka \"whole-program\" optimization rather than individual library optimization\r\n- Windows can now be built with clang-cl and MSYS2/MinGW64\r\n  * MinGW is not on CI yet, but early testing has shown it performs much better than MSVC\r\n- On UNIX-like systems, you can now build without any bundled dependencies at all\r\n- Our docs have been completely refactored, including a new [User handbook](https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden/src/branch/master/docs/User.md)\r\n- MbedTLS 3 is now supported\r\n- Debian 12, 13, and Ubuntu 24.04 are now fully supported\r\n- Even saner build identification\r\n- All assets have been optimized to take up less space\r\n- Many old, subpar reimplementations of Boost/stdlib functionalities were removed\r\n  * As a consequence, *BSD support has been improved, and many deadlocks/weird bugs have been fixed on other platforms.\r\n- aarch64 is now fully supported for Linux, macOS, and Windows, though all three are experimental\r\n- Qt versions from 6.4.2 to 6.10 are now fully supported\r\n  * Earlier versions are entirely untested, and Qt 5 is fully out-of-support.\r\n- Support for building with CCache has been improved\r\n- Windows 8.1 is now supported\r\n  * Note that your device still MUST support Vulkan 1.1 or OpenGL 4.6\r\n\r\n## Builds\r\n\r\nSeveral new builds are available. Builds marked as \"standard\" are the normal builds without PGO or similar.\r\n\r\n- Linux/clang\r\n  * Clang theoretically provides better optimizations than GCC at the cost of potential instability. Thus, these builds *should* perform better but may have an additional glitch or two.\r\n- Windows/clang\r\n  * Same deal as Linux, though it's still unfortunately limited by the MSVC backend's horrific optimization.\r\n- Linux/PGO\r\n  * PGO (profile-guided optimization) uses data from prior compilations to determine the \"hotspots\" found within the codebase. Using these hotspots, it can allocate more resources towards these heavily-used areas, and thus generally see improved performance to the tune of ~10-50%, depending on the specific game, hardware, and platform.\r\n- Windows/PGO\r\n  * Same deal as Linux, though it may be more unstable as PGO is tested much more frequently on Linux.\r\n- macOS\r\n  * macOS still has significant graphical/performance issues and will likely crash A LOT.\r\n- Debian 12/13/Ubuntu 24.04\r\n  * These are prebuilt `.deb` files for Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 12/13 (Bookworm/Trixie), for both amd64 and aarch64. While experimental, they should provide better system integration than the AppImage, at the cost of not bundling the latest MESA drivers.\r\n\r\n## TLDR\r\n\r\n**So... you scrolled down here and ignored us telling you multiple times to thoroughly read the changelog**. What do you need to know?\r\n\r\n- New updates for games, including TotK 1.4.2 and BotW 1.8.2, now work, alongside UltraCam and other mods for these updates\r\n- Firmware 20.x is now supported, though some features of the home menu may not work as expected.\r\n- If you get a scary popup saying orphaned profiles were found, backup ALL your save data, then delete all but the most recently updated/most populated profile folders.\r\n  * Read the top of the changelog for more info.\r\n- As per usual, graphical bugs and glitches have been reduced, performance was increased, etc.\r\n- *Some* improvements to Legends: Z-A are present, but expect flickering and vertex explosions.\r\n- There are lots of new features, which you'll know about if you read the changelog ;)\r\n\r\n## Packages\r\n\r\nDesktop builds will automatically put data in `~/.local/share/eden` on Linux, or \r\n`%APPDATA%/eden` on Windows. You may optionally create a `user` directory in the \r\nsame directory as the executable/AppImage to store data there instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nLinux packages are distributed via AppImage. Each build is optimized for a specific architecture.\r\nSee the *Description* column for more info. Note that legacy builds will always work on newer systems.\r\n\r\n| Build | Description |\r\n| ----- | ----------- |\r\n| [amd64 (GCC)](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc1/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc1-amd64-gcc-standard.AppImage) | ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc1/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc1-amd64-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | For any modern AMD or Intel CPU (GCC build) |\r\n| [Steam Deck (GCC)](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc1/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc1-steamdeck-gcc-standard.AppImage) | ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc1/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc1-steamdeck-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | For Steam Deck and other >= Zen 2 AMD CPUs (GCC build) |\r\n| [armv8-a (GCC)](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc1/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc1-aarch64-gcc-standard.AppImage) | ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc1/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc1-aarch64-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | For ARM CPUs made in mid-2021 or earlier (GCC build) |\r\n| [amd64 (legacy) (GCC)](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc1/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc1-legacy-gcc-standard.AppImage) | ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc1/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc1-legacy-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | For CPUs older than 2013 or so (GCC build) |\r\n| [ROG Ally X (GCC)](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc1/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc1-rog-ally-gcc-standard.AppImage) | ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.4-rc1/Eden-Linux-v0.0.4-rc1-rog-ally-gcc-standard.AppImage.zsync)) | For ROG Ally X and other >= Zen 4 AMD CPUs (GCC build) |\r\n\r\nWe are additionally providing experimental packages built with Clang, rather than GCC.

          "body": "## Changelog\r\n\r\nThis release contains many low-level and build system improvements, alongside game fixes and expanded platform support for macOS and Android/x86_64. Additionally, the experimental *Overlay Applet* has been added, which can be accessed via \"Enable Overlay Applet\" and holding the home button for a short time, much like a real Switch.\r\n\r\n## Universal\r\n\r\n- Improved shader compilation speed\r\n- Fixed the \"Audio Engine\" setting not properly saving\r\n- Low-level optimizations and performance improvements (as always)\r\n- Experimental support for overlay and system setup applets\r\n- Fixed some system settings not saving under certain conditions\r\n- Fixed some race conditions and cache/memory issues on NCE\r\n- GPU accuracy levels have been reworked. Use \"Performance\" for high performance but more frequent graphical issues, \"Accurate\" for less graphical glitches at the cost of performance, and \"Balanced\" for a mix of the two.\r\n  * *Accurate* is not needed on many titles. Most titles that required High before (Pokemon Legends: Z-A, Pokemon Scarlet/Violet, etc.) can safely use Balanced.\r\n- Fixed Metroid Prime 4 issues\r\n- Fixed game icons on the Switch Home Menu (QLaunch)\r\n- Reduced JIT latency by removing unnecessary reg_allocs\r\n- Themed logo for the New Year and Christmas\r\n- Fixed a memory leak in video decoding that could cause crashes in games such as Echoes of Wisdom\r\n\r\n## Renderer\r\n\r\n- Further improvements to Pokemon Legends: Z-A and Scarlet/Violet graphical issues\r\n- Fixed Lego Horizon white screen\r\n- Fixed blurring in Burnout\r\n- All platforms and drivers will now attempt to continue even if the driver is determined to be unsuitable\r\n  * *This also allows the experimental KosmicKrisp MESA driver to run on macOS, and the Dozen/dzn driver to run on WSL*\r\n- Swapchain presentation now uses a faster deque method\r\n  \r\n## Desktop\r\n\r\n- Network configuration can now be done per-game\r\n- Fixed macOS Vulkan crash\r\n- Enabled VideoToolbox video accelerator on macOS\r\n- Fixed the delay in mouse panning\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n\r\n- Reworked the setup screen to use smaller buttons rather than giant pages for each operation\r\n- Fixed some edge cases where game decryption and mod loading would take longer than usual\r\n- Significantly reduced final APK size\r\n  * The way FFmpeg was built on Android has changed to use the same method as other platforms. This resulted in FFmpeg\r\n    being able to be statically linked rather than distributed as a shared library like before. Some further cuts to unneeded\r\n    libraries, encoders, and decoders were also done, ultimately resulting in a ~9MB smaller APK that is also *truly* 16KB-aligned.\r\n- Removed the now-unnecessary Release Fences Early toggle.\r\n- Removed the now-unnecessary Frame Interpolation, aka Enhanced Frame Pacing, setting.\r\n  * This option used to help with frame pacing, but further improvements to our Vulkan backend have resulted in it being unnecessary.\r\n\r\n## Internal\r\n\r\n- Initial Windows 7 support\r\n  * This is currently command-line only, though support for Qt is in the works\r\n- Improved NetBSD and macOS support\r\n- Initial Android x86_64 (ChromeOS, Atom) support\r\n- Invalid kernel service paths are marked as unreachable\r\n- Vibration and mouse threads are given less priority\r\n- Debug asserts now also display the expression of the asserts\r\n- Removed unneeded HeapTracker on Linux (fixes some performance and memory issues)\r\n- Fixed some cases of the \"Filesystem object at ... is not a directory\" warning\r\n- Stubbed parental controls and some other stuff from Firmware 21\r\n\r\n## Platform Support\r\n\r\nThe following platforms have been elevated to first-class support:\r\n\r\n- Linux/aarch64\r\n  * For Gentoo users, `games-emulation/eden-0.0.4` is now keyworded for `~arm64`.\r\n- Windows/arm64\r\n- macOS\r\n- Android/x86_64\r\n\r\n# Packages\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nLinux packages are distributed via AppImage.\r\n[zsync](https://zsync.moria.org.uk/) files are provided for easier updating, such as via\r\n[AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM).\r\n\r\n| Build Type | GCC | PGO | Notes |\r\n|------------|-----|-----|-------|\r\n| amd64 |

No new features will be added to the 0.0.3 branch, and updates will only occur if critical regressions or bugs are found, in which case we will release it as 0.0.3.x. Or, perhaps, some better support for macOS...?\r\n\r\nThis release contains:\r\n- platform parity improvements, especially for Solaris and \\*BSD,\r\n- several incremental bug fixes to Vulkan, JIT, and CMake\r\n- minor UI fixes\r\n- improvements upon changes introduced in prior RCs\r\n- and support for some new games and updates\r\n\r\nUpdating is recommended for all users.\r\n\r\nThe following changelog is for changes from RC3 *only*. For the full 0.0.3 changelog, scroll further.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n- GPU driver download from EmuReady (Producdevity)\r\n- Updated defaults and clarified description for Extended Dynamic State (Pavel, MaranBr)\r\n- Added separate DMA precision level option (MaranBr, crueter)\r\n  * Notably, higher precision levels can enable games like Ender Magnolia to run on Normal GPU accuracy.\r\n- Incremental Vulkan improvements (Wildcard, JPikachu, MaranBr)\r\n  * Improved stencil handling\r\n  * Improved master semaphore submits\r\n  * Fix VertexInput handling\r\n  * Improved memory allocations\r\n    - Notably, this fixes slowdowns on Super Mario Odyssey on weaker hardware (incl. Steam Deck)\r\n- JIT improvements (lizzie)\r\n- Fix remaining MK8DX controller applet freezes (MaranBr)\r\n- Fixed controls dialog text clipping (crueter)\r\n  * On Linux, the Dark theme may still clip if the controls window is forced to its minimum size. \r\n  * We are still investigating this, however, deleting `~/.config/qt6ct` may fix it.\r\n- Host MMU Emulation/Fastmem configuration outside of Debug (MaranBr)\r\n  * Generally, this isn't needed to be changed except on some BSDs\r\n- Option to disable NCA verification (Maufeat, crueter)\r\n  * This enables many new updates--including SMO 1.4.x and Pokemon S/V 4.0.0--to install and run, when they previously couldn't.\r\n  * Note that many updates such as those for BotW and TotK may still not work at this time.\r\n- Removed Firmware 20+ warning on the game list (crueter)\r\n  * Firmware 20+ is NOT supported at this time.\r\n  * Although games may run fine with it, Eden will warn you if you attempt to run the home menu with new firmware installed.\r\n  * If Eden warns you despite running earlier firmware, your firmware or keys are corrupt or pirated, and thus can't be read properly.\r\n- Initial stubs for new firmware functions (Maufeat, Pavel)\r\n  * This enables some games such as Hollow Knight: Silksong to run.\r\n\r\n### Internal\r\n- Improved Solaris, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD support (Lizzie, SDK-Chan, crueter)\r\n- Improved OpenSSL/SDL2 bundled package fetching (crueter)\r\n- CMake dependency prefetching (crueter)\r\n  * The dependency resolution system was rewritten to take in JSON files (`cpmfile.json`), where a script can be run to fetch dependencies *before* configure time.\r\n  * Notably, this re-enables NixOS builds, and some other distributions with network sandboxes may see benefits from this.\r\n- Fix compilation on clang (Lizzie)\r\n- Small compliance/performance improvements with fmt, ankerl, libstdc++, and more (Lizzie)\r\n- Finalized AllocObjSetCtx (SDK-Chan)\r\n\r\n## Changes since 0.0.2\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Click to open</summary>\r\n\r\n## Platforms\r\nPlease note that platforms outside of Windows, Linux, and Android are still in an experimental state. You are unlikely to receive support *unless* you can provide useful debugging info.\r\n\r\n- Solaris/OpenIndiana support (Lizzie841)\r\n- Improved macOS support (crueter, Lizzie841, Maufeat)\r\n- FreeBSD/OpenBSD Support (Lizzie841, SDK-Chan)\r\n- Improvements for dependencies on Solaris and FreeBSD (crueter)\r\n\r\n## Universal\r\n- JIT backend improvements (Lizzie841)\r\n- Improved Fast GPU time (crueter, Camille LaVey)\r\n  * Higher overclock values increase resolution at the cost of performance\r\n- Fast CPU time option (crueter, Camille LaVey)\r\n  * Overclocks the emulated CPU.

Most of the new updates cause black screens, ARM panics, or crashes.\r\n  * Including these in your game directory *shouldn't* cause crashes, but we recommend avoiding them entirely for the time being.\r\n- Using firmware above 19.0.1 causes crashes in the Home Menu.\r\n- Decryption keys from 20.0.0 or newer cause some games to not be properly read or recognized.\r\n- EmuDeck messes with Eden's internal file structure.\r\n  * Symlinking `~/.local/share/eden` to EmuDeck's data directory is believed to fix this.\r\n- During migration on Windows, linking often hangs or fails.\r\n  * This either requires the [SeCreateSymbolicLink](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/create-symbolic-links) privilege, or to avoid it entirely.\r\n  * We recommend move or copy for now.\r\n- Certain games crash upon opening the software keyboard applet on Android.\r\n  * This can generally be fixed by changing it to use the custom frontend, via Advanced Settings -> Applets -> Software Keyboard.\r\n\r\n## Internal\r\n- Several submodules were moved in-tree to reduce network load\r\n  * During bisects, run `git submodule deinit -f --all` and `git submodule update --init --recursive` to update submodules properly.\r\n- Updated bundled dependencies and Qt (MaranBr)\r\n- FFmpeg 7.1.1 implementation (MaranBr, Maufeat, Jarrod Norwell)\r\n- FFmpeg code cleanup & proper configuration (MaranBr)\r\n- Improved parity between platforms (crueter, MaranBr, Shinmegumi)\r\n- Reduced duplicate code between Android and Desktop (crueter)\r\n- Sane build identification (crueter)\r\n- Improved GetBufferHistory (Maufeat, Jarrod Norwell)\r\n- Massively reduced fetch time for submodules\r\n  * Nearly all submodules and externals, sans libusb, dynarmic, and very small in-tree libraries, have been moved to source archive downloads.\r\n  * These are grabbed *on-demand*, as opposed to every single submodule being required by default.\r\n  * Source archives are **dramatically** smaller in size than full Git clones; thus, overall clone/fetch time has decreased by a factor of ~10 on Windows and Linux (amd64) with 100Mbps download speed.\r\n- Source packs now include CPM cache and can be built fully offline.\r\n  * Android cannot be built fully offline regardless due to gradlew, so source archives do not currently contain bundled Android dependencies.\r\n- vcpkg has been completely replaced by CPM (CMake Package Manager)\r\n  * CPM is significantly faster, more consistent, and easier to use than vcpkg. This can help reduce headaches and configure/fetch time on Windows and Android.\r\n  * CPM additionally allows for static builds of certain externals that were not previously possible; e.g. Boost, OpenSSL, and other libraries are now available statically, which marginally reduces Android APK, Windows zip, and Linux AppImage package sizes.\r\n  * All system dependencies can additionally be managed by CPM as well; to enforce this, set `YUZU_USE_CPM=ON` (note that this will enforce bundled OpenSSL for the time being)\r\n- CMake dependency prefetching (crueter)\r\n  * The dependency resolution system was rewritten to take in JSON files (`cpmfile.json`), where a script can be run to fetch dependencies *before* configure time.\r\n  * Notably, this re-enables NixOS builds, and some other distributions with network sandboxes may see benefits from this.\r\n- Build & development documentation has been updated to match all of our new changes, and has generally been improved all-around\r\n- MicroProfile was removed (use samply/vtune instead)\r\n- Small compliance/performance improvements with fmt, ankerl, libstdc++, and more (Lizzie)\r\n- Unstubbed services and functions:\r\n  * ZBCSetTable (Lizzie)\r\n  * AllocObjCtx (SDK-Chan)\r\n  * ISBERD (Internal Stage Buffer Entry ReaD) (SDK-Chan, Lizzie)\r\n  * GPFIFOEX1 (SDK-Chan)\r\n  * AdjustRefCount (Maufeat)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Packages\r\n\r\nDesktop builds will automatically put data in `~/.local/share/eden` on Linux, or \r\n`%APPDATA%/eden` on Windows. You may optionally create a `user` directory in the \r\nsame directory as the executable/AppImage to store data there instead.\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nLinux packages are distributed via AppImage. Each build is optimized for a specific architecture.\r\nSee the *Description* column for more info. Note that legacy builds will always work on newer systems.\r\nzsync files are provided for use with certain AppImage updaters.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Due to ongoing build/CI issues and lack of available hardware for testing, ARM builds of Linux will not be distributed for the time being. If you want to help our developers acquire ARM hardware, please [donate](https://liberapay.com/crueter)!\r\n\r\n>[!WARNING]\r\n>By default, the AppImages enforce the `xcb` platform for Qt. Wayland causes a significant \r\n>amount of issues that simply can't be solved on our end. You may change it to Wayland if you \r\n>wish, but expect things to break. You will only receive limited support if using Wayland.\r\n\r\n| Build | Description |\r\n| ----- | ----------- |\r\n| [amd64 (legacy)](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-legacy.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-legacy.AppImage.zsync)) | For CPUs older than 2013 or so |\r\n| [amd64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-amd64.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-amd64.AppImage.zsync)) | For any modern AMD or Intel CPU |\r\n| [Steam Deck](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-steamdeck.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-steamdeck.AppImage.zsync)) | For Steam Deck and other >= Zen 2 AMD CPUs |\r\n| [ROG Ally X](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-rog-ally.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-rog-ally.AppImage.zsync)) | For ROG Ally X and other >= Zen 4 AMD CPUs |\r\n| aarch64 (WIP) | For any 64-bit ARM CPU.

          "body": "This is the third release candidate for version 0.0.3. This RC is in feature-freeze, and is intended to help test upcoming features and fix any pertinent issues and bugs. All users are encouraged to test out this release and provide feedback/issue reports when applicable. In the meantime, if you prefer to have the most stable experience possible, you are likely better off waiting for the stable release.\r\n\r\nIf this RC is deemed safe to release after the initial 1-week testing phase, it will be promoted to stable and distributed as the final 0.0.3 release. Otherwise, more candidates will be published, and after final tests are concluded and the last RC is marked ready for release, it will be promoted to stable and released as 0.0.3.\r\n\r\nWe apologize for the delay in this RC. During our tests, many critical regressions popped up, and some took a long time to track down and fix. Additionally, a large quantity of long-standing build issues continued to pop up, and necessitated major rewrites to our build system. We hope that this candidate is ultimately promoted to stable 0.0.3 and its many fixes can be enjoyed by all.\r\n\r\nThis release contains:\r\n- a critical fix for LAN connection issues,\r\n- several regressions fixes from Yuzu, 0.0.2, and RC1,\r\n- major new Vulkan and memory fixes,\r\n- and large-scale improvements to the build system and CI\r\n\r\n## Regressions\r\n\r\n- Fixed certain RDNA3/Android graphics bugs, notably in TotK and BotW (Maufeat, Testers)\r\n  * Notably, this fixes BotW, TotK, Shadow Generations, and other titles\r\n- Fixed LAN connection issues (Maufeat, Testers)\r\n  * Some users have reported that this fixes LAN on MK8DX 3.0.5, but results have been inconsistent. We still recommend 3.0.3 for LAN play for now.\r\n- Fixed Release Fences Early option (Pavel)\r\n- Fix MSAA-related crashes in FE:Engage and other games (Maufeat)\r\n- Fixed LRU Cache on TotK 1.2.1 and other updates (wildcard)\r\n- Fixed sample shading, and added a slider for the intensity thereof (crueter, Wildcard)\r\n  * This option has been shown to *improve* performance in some setups, contrary to what the tooltip says. Further testing is required to determine all of its effects, but for the time being, use it if you want to enjoy better shader quality.\r\n  \r\n## New Changes\r\n\r\n- Improved Solaris/FreeBSD compatibility (Lizzie, SDK-Chan, crueter)\r\n- Sync Memory Operations option (Higgs, MaranBr)\r\n  * Notably, this fixes certain collection games, Abathor, Clock Tower Rewind, Guns of Fury, Ninja Five-O, and more\r\n  * This option *can* decrease performance, though it's only believed to affect Unreal Engine 4 & 5 games.\r\n- Full ISBERD Unstub (SDK-Chan, Camille LaVey)\r\n  * Notably, this fixes some minor graphical issues in M&L:Brothership and other titles\r\n- Fix Windows styling (MaranBr, Maufeat, crueter)\r\n- Fix unsafe/safe memory processing logic (Torzu, Higgs, MaranBr)\r\n  * Notably, this fixes Princess Peach, Ender Magnolia, M&L Brothership, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Borderlands 2, and more\r\n- Properly ignore comments in cheats (notenergydrinks)\r\n- Updated Ukrainian translation (Rondo)\r\n- Android EmuReady integration (Producdevity)\r\n  * This feature is in beta! We are adding it to this release candidate to get additional testing before its final form in 0.0.3\r\n- Android Redesign (Producdevity)\r\n  * The new default theme is the *Eden* theme, which uses Eden's official color palette alongside synthwave-style gradients.\r\n- Reduce Vulkan validation errors (wildcard)\r\n- Fixed critical Vulkan memory leaks (weakboson)\r\n  * Notably, this fixes memory leaks and crashes in DB FighterZ, Dragon's Dogma, P5:Royal, Mario Strikers, Yoshi's Crafted World and others that previously required mods to avoid crashes\r\n- Disable unneeded debug options in Vulkan (crueter, wildcard)\r\n  * Technically, this can improve performance, but the effect is marginal\r\n- Add Revolt links alongside Discord (crueter)\r\n- Add X links alongside Discord and Revolt (Bix)\r\n- Avoid infinite kernel object loops (MaranBr)\r\n  * Notably, this fixes certain sequences of actions in BotW, especially w.r.t shrines\r\n- FFmpeg updated to 7.1.1 on Linux (MaranBr)\r\n- Fix CUDA on Linux for NVidia (MaranBr)\r\n- Fixed Windows icon aliasing and size (Lizzie)\r\n- Normalize single-layer TICs (Wildcard)\r\n  * Notably, this fixes God Eater 3\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- Font scaling on the Linux AppImage is off on certain setups\r\n\r\n## Known Games Fixed\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Click to open</summary>\r\nThis is a partial list of games that are noted to be fixed or improved since v0.0.3-rc2. Special thanks to our tester, PistolaoBR, for compiling this list, and all of our other testers for their additional work in identifying critical bugs and testing large amounts of bugfixes. Most of these were tested on Nvidia, but had additional testing on Adreno and AMD.\r\n\r\n### Force Closes\r\n\r\nThese games previously force closed randomly, but are fixed by the Sync Memory Operations option regardless of accuracy:\r\n\r\n- Princess Peach\r\n- Ender Magnolia\r\n- Mario & Luigi Brothership\r\n- SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS\r\n- EA SPORTS FC25\r\n\r\n### Booting\r\n\r\nThese games previously did not boot or crashed early:\r\n\r\n- Collection games (neogeo, lunar, Gex, Hotline Miami, etc)\r\n- Abathor\r\n- Clock Tower Rewind\r\n- Guns of Fury\r\n- Ninja Five-O\r\n- The Walking Dead A New Frontier\r\n- Dead of Darkness\r\n- Ghost Trick Phantom Detective\r\n- S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\r\n- God Eater 3\r\n- Borderlands 2\r\n  * This game only works with `Sync Memory Operations` on.\r\n- Cocoon\r\n\r\n### Updates\r\n\r\nThese games previously would not work with some of their updates applied:\r\n\r\n- Snufkin Melody of Moominvalley\r\n- Azure Striker Gunvolt Trilogy Enhanced\r\n- Witchroid Vania: A Magical Girl’s Fantastical Adventures\r\n- Sword of the Guardian\r\n- Crashlands\r\n- Cassette Beasts\r\n- Haven\r\n- BrokenSword Templars\r\n- Blazing Beaks\r\n- Mighty Goose\r\n- Potionomics: Masterwork Edition\r\n- Thronefall\r\n- Miraculous: Paris Under Siege\r\n- Storm Edge\r\n- While We Wait Here\r\n- Remnants of Naezith\r\n- Grapple Dogs Cosmic Canines\r\n- Across The Obelisk\r\n- Cult of the Lamb\r\n- Severed Steel\r\n- Noob - The Factionless\r\n- Romancing Saga 2\r\n  * This game still has major lighting issues, however\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Internal\r\nThe build system has been almost entirely overhauled:\r\n\r\n- Submodules and externals are now handled by CPM (CMake Package Manager) (crueter)\r\n  * These are downloaded as source archives, not full git clones\r\n  * These are grabbed *on-demand*, as opposed to every single submodule being required by default.\r\n  * Source archives are **dramatically** smaller in size than full Git clones; thus, overall clone/fetch time has decreased by a factor of ~10 on Windows and Linux (amd64) with 100Mbps download speed.\r\n  * Source packs include CPM cache and can be built fully offline.\r\n    + Android cannot be built fully offline regardless due to gradlew, so source archives do not currently contain bundled Android dependencies.\r\n- vcpkg has also been replaced by CPM (crueter)\r\n  * CPM is significantly faster, more consistent, and easier to use than vcpkg. This can help reduce headaches and configure/fetch time on Windows and Android.\r\n  * CPM additionally allows for static builds of certain externals that were not previously possible; e.g. Boost, OpenSSL, and other libraries are now available statically, which marginally reduces Android APK, Windows zip, and Linux AppImage package sizes.\r\n  * All system dependencies can additionally be managed by CPM as well; to enforce this, set `YUZU_USE_CPM=ON` (note that this will enforce bundled OpenSSL for the time being)\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- Build & development documentation has been updated to match all of our new changes, and has generally been improved all-around\r\n- MicroProfile was removed (use samply/vtune instead)\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n- @elementary-particle\r\n- @NotAnEnergyDrinkAddict\r\n- Wildcard\r\n\r\n## Packages\r\n\r\nDesktop builds will automatically put data in `~/.local/share/eden` on Linux, or \r\n`%APPDATA%/eden` on Windows. You may optionally create a `user` directory in the \r\nsame directory as the executable/AppImage to store data there instead.\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nLinux packages are distributed via AppImage. Each build is optimized for a specific architecture.\r\nSee the *Description* column for more info. Note that legacy builds will always work on newer systems.\r\nzsync files are provided for use with certain AppImage updaters.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Due to ongoing build issues and lack of available hardware for testing, ARM builds of Linux will not be distributed for the time being. If you want to help our developers acquire ARM hardware, please [donate](https://liberapay.com/crueter)!\r\n\r\n>[!WARNING]\r\n>By default, the AppImages enforce the `xcb` platform for Qt. Wayland causes a significant \r\n>amount of issues that simply can't be solved on our end. You may change it to Wayland if you \r\n>wish, but expect things to break. You will only receive limited support if using Wayland.\r\n\r\n| Build | Description |\r\n| ----- | ----------- |\r\n| [amd64 (legacy)](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-rc3-legacy.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-rc3-legacy.AppImage.zsync)) | For CPUs older than 2013 or so |\r\n| [amd64](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-rc3-amd64.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-rc3-amd64.AppImage.zsync)) | For any modern AMD or Intel CPU |\r\n| [Steam Deck](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-rc3-steamdeck.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-rc3-steamdeck.AppImage.zsync)) | For Steam Deck and other >= Zen 2 AMD CPUs |\r\n| [ROG Ally X](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-rc3-rog-ally.AppImage) ([zsync](https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/download/v0.0.3-rc3/Eden-Linux-v0.0.3-rc3-rog-ally.AppImage.zsync)) | For ROG Ally X and other >= Zen 4 AMD CPUs |\r\n| aarch64 (WIP) | For any 64-bit ARM CPU.

          "body": "# Changelog\r\n\r\nThis is the first release candidate for version 0.0.3. This RC is in feature-freeze, and is intended to help test upcoming features and fix any pertinent issues and bugs. All users are encouraged to test out this release and provide feedback/issue reports when applicable. In the meantime, if you prefer to have the most stable experience possible, you are likely better off waiting for the stable release.\r\n\r\nIf this RC is deemed safe to release after the initial 1-week testing phase, it will be promoted to stable and distributed as the final 0.0.3 release. Otherwise, more candidates will be published, and after final tests are concluded and the last RC is marked ready for release, it will be promoted to stable and released as 0.0.3.\r\n\r\n## Platforms\r\nPlease note that platforms outside of Windows, Linux, and Android are still in an experimental state.

Most of the new updates cause black screens, ARM panics, or crashes.\r\n  * Including these in your game directory *shouldn't* cause crashes, but we recommend avoiding them entirely for the time being.\r\n- Using firmware above 19.0.1 causes crashes in the Home Menu.\r\n- Decryption keys from 20.0.0 or newer cause some games to not be properly read or recognized.\r\n- EmuDeck messes with Eden's internal file structure.\r\n  * Symlinking `~/.local/share/eden` to EmuDeck's data directory is believed to fix this.\r\n- During migration on Windows, linking often hangs or fails.\r\n  * This either requires the [SeCreateSymbolicLink](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/create-symbolic-links) privilege, or to avoid it entirely.\r\n  * We recommend move or copy for now.\r\n- Certain games crash upon opening the software keyboard applet on Android.\r\n  * This can generally be fixed by changing it to use the custom frontend, via Advanced Settings -> Applets -> Software Keyboard.\r\n\r\n## Internal\r\n- Several submodules were moved in-tree to reduce network load\r\n  * During bisects, run `git submodule deinit -f --all` and `git submodule update --init --recursive` to update submodules properly.\r\n- Updated bundled dependencies and Qt (MaranBr)\r\n- FFmpeg 7.1.1 implementation (MaranBr, Maufeat, Jarrod Norwell)\r\n- FFmpeg code cleanup & proper configuration (MaranBr)\r\n- Improved parity between platforms (crueter, MaranBr, Shinmegumi)\r\n- Reduced duplicate code between Android and Desktop (crueter)\r\n- Improved build documentation & scripting (crueter, Lizzie)\r\n- Sane build identification (crueter)\r\n- Improved GetBufferHistory (Maufeat, Jarrod Norwell)\r\n- Improved build documentation and scripting (Lizzie, crueter)\r\n- Unstubbed services and functions:\r\n  * ZBCSetTable (Lizzie)\r\n  * AllocObjCtx (SDK-Chan)\r\n  * ISBERD (Internal Stage Buffer Entry ReaD) (Lizzie)\r\n  * GPFIFOEX1 (SDK-Chan)\r\n  * AdjustRefCount (Maufeat)\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n- Aleksandr Popovich (Lime3DS)\r\n- @Lizzie841\r\n- @MaranBr\r\n- @Shinmegumi\r\n- @allisonbzk\r\n- Rondo (translating)\r\n- @Maufeat\r\n- @Gamer64ytb (Mandarine3DS)\r\n- SDK-Chan\r\n- @JarrodNorwell (Sudachi)\r\n\r\n## Returning Contributors\r\n- @CamilleLaVey\r\n- @crueter\r\n- @bixbr\r\n- @MrPurple666\r\n- @PavelBARABANOV\r\n- @jpikachu\r\n- @AntaBaka02\r\n\r\n## Special Thanks\r\n- Bix for providing Git hosting in the absence of a VPS\r\n- samueru & pflyly for CI assistance\r\n- (Not) crueter's ISP for bandwidth limiting him 🥀\r\n- Everyone who has donated to us\r\n- Our wonderful testers!\r\n- AYANEO for providing Camille, Mr. Purple, and crueter devices to test & provide support for\r\n\r\n# Packages\r\n\r\nDesktop builds will automatically put data in `~/.local/share/eden` on Linux, or \r\n`%APPDATA%\\eden` on Windows.

By default the accuracy is set to standard, compared to high it decreases the amount of memory used and improves performance.

Disabling this setting can result in emulation slowdowns with certain displays, so it's recommended to leave it enabled unless you know what you're doing.\r\n\r\n# Windows\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where certain characters in an application name could become corrupted when creating a desktop shortcut. | @RedBlackAka \r\n\r\n# Technical\r\n\r\n- If certain features are disabled at compile-time in the desktop build, code related to those features is now more aggressively excluded. | @RedBlackAka #1630\r\n- Detection of CPUs using the FMA4 extension has been disabled, as this extension is not used by Azahar. | @RedBlackAka #1746\r\n- Added NATVIS to BitField class, allowing for better debugging in Visual Studio. | @PabloMK7 #1731",

          "body": "This update re-enables support for the .3ds extension, which was previously removed in Azahar's initial release.\r\n\r\nWe previously made this change as a clear motion to distance ourselves from the mass piracy that lead to the closure of Yuzu and Citra, however, we have now determined that this change is causing more harm than good.\r\n\r\nWe've noticed that the removal of the .3ds extension has caused unnecessary fragmentation in the 3DS emulation community. This led to the creation of dubiously safe forks, to which a portion of the Azahar userbase migrated. These forks used unsafe deployment practices, presented licensing concerns, and confused users as to whether the forks were part of the upstream Azahar project. These circumstances created an unhealthy open-source development environment, and we don't believe that this is in the best interest of the 3DS emulation scene.\r\n\r\nGiven that the removal of the .3ds extension was originally an act of project philosophy rather than a technical change, we don't want this decision to overshadow the very real leaps which have been made in Azahar over the last year. Because of this, we have decided that it's for the best of everyone that we revert the change.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that support for encrypted ROMs is still disabled; This will not change for the foreseeable future. Unlike the .3ds extension, which is a matter of project philosophy, encrypted ROMs still present actual legal challenges that we do not want to take on.\r\n\r\nWe have decided to publish this change in its own Azahar release to avoid the change overshadowing additions made in the future 2125 update.\r\n\r\nWe hope that this change will help to bring the 3DS emulation community closer together.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Azahar 2124.3 Changelog\r\n\r\n# All\r\n\r\n- Re-added support for the .3ds file extension. | @PabloMK7 #1701",

          "body": "Similarly to 2124.1, this minor release focuses on fixing high-priority bugs and issues.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it introduces a new \"Update Channel\" feature on desktop builds, allowing you to receive in-app notifications for pre-release builds such as betas and release candidates, even when running a stable release. We are releasing this feature in the hope that it will encourage more users to try the prereleases, experiencing the new features early and helping us to polish the final release by reporting issues we may have missed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Azahar 2124.2 Changelog\r\n\r\n# Desktop\r\n\r\n- Introduced a new Update Channel feature | @OpenSauce04 #1659 \r\n  - This feature can be accessed from the General section of the settings menu under a new \"Updates\" subsection.\r\n  - The available channels are \"Stable\" and \"Prerelease\".\r\n  - When using pre-release builds, update notifications will still be received for newer pre-releases regardless of the setting value to allow important fixes to be distributed. As such, this new feature primarily applies to the stable build.\r\n- Added a note to the \"Enable async presentation\" setting indicating that it adds 1 frame of input lag. | @Immersion95 #1669 \r\n- The Vulkan texture filtering functionality, which was introduced in 2124, has been temporarily disabled due to unforeseen stability issues. | @PabloMK7 #1678 \r\n  - This feature is planned to be re-enabled in the 2125 update following additional polishing and another round of public testing. Apologies for any inconvenience.\r\n\r\n# MacOS\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where, when using an Application Directory, Azahar may hang or have a flickering user interface after launching. | @OpenSauce04 #1665\r\n\r\n# All\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where plugins that were intended to run for all title IDs instead didn't run at all. | @OpenSauce04 #1679 \r\n  - This notably fixes an issue where the Nimbus plugin required to play Animal Crossing: New Leaf online failed to load properly.\r\n- Updated SDL to version 2.32.10. | @OpenSauce04 #1680 \r\n  - This notably fixes an issue where connecting/disconnecting a controller during emulation on macOS would cause the emulator to crash.\r\n- Fixed an issue where, when launching from the HOME menu, applications which required forced accurate multiplication wouldn't have it activated. | @PabloMK7 #1671 \r\n- Fixed an issue where, when loading a save state, accurate multiplication would be automatically and erroneously disabled until emulation was restarted. | @PabloMK7 #1671 \r\n- Fixed an issue where game graphics could momentarily appear broken after loading a save state. | @PabloMK7 #1672 \r\n- Fixed an issue where custom textures would be disabled after loading a save state until emulation was restarted. | @PabloMK7 #1672 \r\n- Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam now has forced accurate multiplication, improving compatibility. | @PabloMK7 #1671 \r\n\r\n# Android\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where, on many setups, the VSync setting could appear to be disabled, but was actually enabled. | @OpenSauce04 #1658 \r\n  - This was addressed by properly disabling the VSync setting in these configurations, matching the setting's prior appearance.\r\n- Fixed an issue where the Retroid Pocket screen attachment could function incorrectly on the Odin 2. | @DavidRGriswold #1667 \r\n- The circle pad/c-stick binding UI has been updated to be more clearly understandable. | @DavidRGriswold #1676\r\n\r\n# Technical\r\n\r\n- CMake now explicitly searches for `Qt6::GuiPrivate` before linking with it, improving build compatibility in certain environments. | @marcin-serwin #1657",

          "body": "It's been a while since the last major update, and we've been working hard during that time to bring many improvements to the emulator.<br>In fact, by a decent margin, this is Azahar's largest update ever!\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the changelog below to see what we've been working on and learn about the new features which are available.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs previously announced and explained in an announcement on our Discord server, this release increases the minimum Android version from Android 9 to Android 10.\r\n\r\nDevices running Android 9 will no longer be able to update beyond Azahar 2123.4.1.\r\n\r\nSee the announcement post for additional information.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Azahar 2124 Changelog\r\n\r\n# All\r\n\r\n- Implemented emulated cartridge insertion functionality. | @PabloMK7 #1304 \r\n  - This causes the cartridge to appear inserted on the emulated HOME menu, and otherwise act as an inserted cartridge would on real hardware.\r\n- Implemented texture filtering while using the Vulkan renderer. | @jbm11208 #1116, @jbm11208 #1513, @PabloMK7 #1561\r\n- Added support for secondary screen opacity while using the Vulkan renderer. | Briar @OpenSauce04 #1255\r\n- Improved HLE NWM support. | @lannoene #1375\r\n  - This enables multiplayer functionality with use of the LLE DLP module in several new games, including Luigi's Mansion, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, and Mario Kart 7.\r\n- Implemented HLE DSP sleep and wakeup functionality. | @PabloMK7 #1529 \r\n  - This fixes an issue where games could have bugged sound when opened from the HOME menu.\r\n- Added new SMDH region free patch setting which is enabled by default. | @PabloMK7 #1541\r\n  - This functions similarly to the region free patch from Luma3DS.\r\n- Improved memory mode handling, allowing extended memory games to be launched from the HOME menu. | @PabloMK7 #1534, @PabloMK7 #1560 \r\n- Improved plugin memory management, allowing launching applications with plugins from the HOME menu. | @PabloMK7 #1554 \r\n- Changed unimplemented GAS mode behaviour, fixing visual issues in the Monster Hunter games when a blur effect is used.\r\n- Fixed garbled HOME menu graphics when suspending an application. | @PabloMK7 #1518\r\n- Fixed a long-standing issue where microphone input could sound slowed-down or stuttery. | @PabloMK7 #1610\r\n- Various improvements to stereoscopic 3D settings and functionality. | @DavidRGriswold #1212\r\n- Implemented `AM:CancelImportProgram`, allowing emulated CIA installations to be cancelled mid-way. | @PabloMK7 #1535\r\n- Improved implementation of `MemorySystem::GetPhysicalPointer`, resulting in a very minor performance improvement. | @PabloMK7 #1587\r\n- Moved the plugin framebuffer address ownership from the `plg:ldr` service to the memory system, resulting in a very minor performance improvement. | @PabloMK7 #1572\r\n- Fixed a possible crash in the Vulkan renderer caused by malformed geometry shaders. | @PabloMK7 #1585\r\n- Switch to using xxHash instead of CityHash64 and improve ShaderSetup hashing behaviour, resulting in a minor performance improvement. | @PabloMK7 #1592\r\n- Implemented game-specific fixes for broken geometry shaders in the following SEGA 3D Classics titles: Thunder Blade, After Burner, Power Drift.\r\n- The `play_time.bin` file has now been moved from the log directory to the sysdata directory. | @OpenSauce04 #1310 \r\n\r\n# Android\r\n\r\n- Increased minimum Android version to Android 10. | @OpenSauce04 #1368\r\n- Added support for compressing and decompression ROM files. | @ne-kle @PabloMK7 #1458\r\n- Implemented background color, second screen opacity, and audio emulation settings from the desktop build. | marsia @rtiangha @OpenSauce04 #1254\r\n- Fixed an issue where Discord could break secondary screen detection on dual-screen devices. | @DavidRGriswold #1455\r\n- Added \"Hide 3DS Images from Android\" setting. | marsia @OpenSauce04 #1254\r\n  - This prevents images related to Azahar from showing up in the Android gallery.\r\n- VSync is now disabled by default on Android due to reasons explained [here](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/pull/1456). | @DavidRGriswold #1456\r\n  - This results in a noticeable reduction in input latency with little to no effect on the visual appearance of games.\r\n  - This change applies retroactively to existing configurations; VSync will be automatically disabled after updating if it was previously enabled.\r\n- Fixed an issue where resetting input bindings to their default value wouldn't actually clear the binding. | @DavidRGriswold #1463\r\n- Fixed a bug where the secondary screen opacity setting was being applied in layouts other than the custom layout. | @DavidRGriswold #1496\r\n- Fixed an issue where certain external gamepads would have inverted axis controls. | @DavidRGriswold #1483 \r\n  - Affected gamepads will have to be re-bound after updating the emulator.\r\n- The emulator UI's refresh rate is no longer limited 60hz on phones with a higher set refresh rate. | @ne-kle\r\n  - During emulation, the display refresh rate is still limited to 60hz to preserve battery life.\r\n- Fixed the Toggle Controls menu having flickering on the bottom edge and having misaligned list clickboxes on certain Android devices. | @OpenSauce04 #1598\r\n- Fixed a bug where the screen size could be detected incorrectly. | @DavidRGriswold #1495 \r\n\r\n# Desktop\r\n\r\n- Implemented batch compression and decompression functionality. | @PabloMK7 #1503\r\n- Improved consistency of capitalization and colon usage in the UI. | @RedBlackAka @OpenSauce04 #1306\r\n- Prevented refreshing game directory while emulation is powered on, avoiding a race condition. | @PabloMK7 #1553  \r\n- Skip Vulkan in API quick selection if unavailable. | @RedBlackAka #1618\r\n\r\n# Docker\r\n\r\n- Added new Docker image download option to release files. | @OpenSauce04 #1493\r\n  - This docker image contains the `azahar-room` executable, allowing local multiplayer rooms to be hosted.\r\n\r\n# Technical\r\n\r\n- ARM macOS binaries are now built using macOS 26 runners. | @OpenSauce04 #1412\r\n- Added new game launch stress testing functionality to the desktop build behind the new `ENABLE_DEVELOPER_OPTIONS` CMake option. | @OpenSauce04 #1442\r\n- Various minor internal improvements to the Android performance overlay. | @OpenSauce04 #1367 \r\n- Fixed build failure on unix-like operating systems introduced by Qt 6.10.0. | @OpenSauce04 #1441\r\n- Moved DSP memory ownership to the memory subsystem. | @PabloMK7 #1520\r\n- Updated dynarmic to the latest version. | @PabloMK7 #1569",

Please expand this drop-down to read more about what this means before installing.\r\n</summary>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a release candidate, this build is not yet considered a stable release, but is instead a build which could be promoted to a stable release if it is sufficiently tested with no major issues being discovered. Ideally, the release candidate period will last for 7 days, however if major issues are discovered, this will be extended to allow for additional testing with a corrected release candidate.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDespite its status as a pre-release build, users are encouraged to test this version to help us catch any newly introduced issues before the build is promoted to a full release. If you do observe such issues, please report them to us on GitHub so we can evaluate them.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf you are unwilling to tolerate potential minor issues, you may be better off waiting until a release candidate is promoted to a full release.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUsers are advised to back up their Azahar user data directory before using a pre-release build.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis changelog is relative to 2124-rc1.<br>For a complete list of the changes in the upcoming 2124 update, please see the [2124-rc1 changelog](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/releases/tag/2124-rc1).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Azahar 2124-rc2 Changelog\r\n\r\n# All\r\n\r\n- Fixed a regression introduced in 2124-rc1 where pre-existing custom textures wouldn't load correctly. | @PabloMK7 #1609\r\n- Fixed a long-standing issue where microphone input could sound slowed-down or stuttery. | @PabloMK7 #1610\r\n\r\n# Docker\r\n\r\n- For Docker images produced by our CI/CD pipeline, the image tag is now set to either the relevant git tag or the current commit's hash. | @OpenSauce04 #1611\r\n  - In 2124-rc1, the image tag was always `latest`.

Please expand this drop-down to read more about what this means before installing.\r\n</summary>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a release candidate, this build is not yet considered a stable release, but is instead a build which could be promoted to a stable release if it is sufficiently tested with no major issues being discovered. Ideally, the release candidate period will last for 7 days, however if major issues are discovered, this will be extended to allow for additional testing with a corrected release candidate.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDespite its status as a pre-release build, users are encouraged to test this version to help us catch any newly introduced issues before the build is promoted to a full release. If you do observe such issues, please report them to us on GitHub so we can evaluate them.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf you are unwilling to tolerate potential minor issues, you may be better off waiting until a release candidate is promoted to a full release.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUsers are advised to back up their Azahar user data directory before using a pre-release build.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since the last major update, and we've been working hard during that time to bring many improvements to the emulator.<br>In fact, by a decent margin, this is Azahar's largest update ever!\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the changelog below to see what we've been working on and learn about the new features which are available.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs previously announced and explained in an announcement on our Discord server, this release increases the minimum Android version from Android 9 to Android 10.\r\n\r\nDevices running Android 9 will no longer be able to update beyond Azahar 2123.4.1.\r\n\r\nSee the announcement post for additional information.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Azahar 2124-rc1 Changelog\r\n\r\n# All\r\n\r\n- Implemented emulated cartridge insertion functionality. | @PabloMK7 #1304 \r\n  - This causes the cartridge to appear inserted on the emulated HOME menu, and otherwise act as an inserted cartridge would on real hardware.\r\n- Implemented texture filtering while using the Vulkan renderer. | @jbm11208 #1116, @jbm11208 #1513, @PabloMK7 #1561\r\n- Added support for secondary screen opacity while using the Vulkan renderer. | Briar @OpenSauce04 #1255\r\n- Improved HLE NWM support. | @lannoene #1375\r\n  - This enables multiplayer functionality with use of the LLE DLP module in several new games, including Luigi's Mansion, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, and Mario Kart 7.\r\n- Implemented HLE DSP sleep and wakeup functionality. | @PabloMK7 #1529 \r\n  - This fixes an issue where games could have bugged sound when opened from the HOME menu.\r\n- Added new SMDH region free patch setting which is enabled by default. | @PabloMK7 #1541\r\n  - This functions similarly to the region free patch from Luma3DS.\r\n- Improved memory mode handling, allowing extended memory games to be launched from the HOME menu. | @PabloMK7 #1534, @PabloMK7 #1560 \r\n- Improved plugin memory management, allowing launching applications with plugins from the HOME menu. | @PabloMK7 #1554 \r\n- Changed unimplemented GAS mode behaviour, fixing visual issues in the Monster Hunter games when a blur effect is used.\r\n- Fixed garbled HOME menu graphics when suspending an application. | @PabloMK7 #1518\r\n- Various improvements to stereoscopic 3D settings and functionality. | @DavidRGriswold #1212\r\n- Implemented `AM:CancelImportProgram`, allowing emulated CIA installations to be cancelled mid-way. | @PabloMK7 #1535\r\n- Improved implementation of `MemorySystem::GetPhysicalPointer`, resulting in a very minor performance improvement. | @PabloMK7 #1587\r\n- Moved the plugin framebuffer address ownership from the `plg:ldr` service to the memory system, resulting in a very minor performance improvement. | @PabloMK7 #1572\r\n- Fixed a possible crash in the Vulkan renderer caused by malformed geometry shaders. | @PabloMK7 #1585\r\n- Switch to using xxHash instead of CityHash64 and improve ShaderSetup hashing behaviour, resulting in a minor performance improvement. | @PabloMK7 #1592\r\n- Implemented game-specific fixes for broken geometry shaders in the following SEGA 3D Classics titles: Thunder Blade, After Burner, Power Drift.\r\n- The `play_time.bin` file has now been moved from the log directory to the sysdata directory. | @OpenSauce04 #1310 \r\n\r\n# Android\r\n\r\n- Increased minimum Android version to Android 10. | @OpenSauce04 #1368\r\n- Added support for compressing and decompression ROM files. | @ne-kle @PabloMK7 #1458\r\n- Implemented background color, second screen opacity, and audio emulation settings from the desktop build. | marsia @rtiangha @OpenSauce04 #1254\r\n- Fixed an issue where Discord could break secondary screen detection on dual-screen devices. | @DavidRGriswold #1455\r\n- Added \"Hide 3DS Images from Android\" setting. | marsia @OpenSauce04 #1254\r\n  - This prevents images related to Azahar from showing up in the Android gallery.\r\n- VSync is now disabled by default on Android due to reasons explained [here](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/pull/1456). | @DavidRGriswold #1456\r\n  - This results in a noticeable reduction in input latency with little to no effect on the visual appearance of games.\r\n  - This change applies retroactively to existing configurations; VSync will be automatically disabled after updating if it was previously enabled.\r\n- Fixed an issue where resetting input bindings to their default value wouldn't actually clear the binding. | @DavidRGriswold #1463\r\n- Fixed a bug where the secondary screen opacity setting was being applied in layouts other than the custom layout. | @DavidRGriswold #1496\r\n- Fixed an issue where certain external gamepads would have inverted axis controls. | @DavidRGriswold #1483 \r\n  - Affected gamepads will have to be re-bound after updating the emulator.\r\n- The emulator UI's refresh rate is no longer limited 60hz on phones with a higher set refresh rate. | @ne-kle\r\n  - During emulation, the display refresh rate is still limited to 60hz to preserve battery life.\r\n- Fixed the Toggle Controls menu having flickering on the bottom edge and having misaligned list clickboxes on certain Android devices. | @OpenSauce04 #1598\r\n- Fixed a bug where the screen size could be detected incorrectly. | @DavidRGriswold #1495 \r\n\r\n# Desktop\r\n\r\n- Implemented batch compression and decompression functionality. | @PabloMK7 #1503\r\n- Improved consistency of capitalization and colon usage in the UI. | @RedBlackAka @OpenSauce04 #1306\r\n- Prevented refreshing game directory while emulation is powered on, avoiding a race condition. | @PabloMK7 #1553  \r\n\r\n# Docker\r\n\r\n- Added new Docker image download option to release files. | @OpenSauce04 #1493\r\n  - This docker image contains the `azahar-room` executable, allowing local multiplayer rooms to be hosted.\r\n\r\n# Technical\r\n\r\n- ARM macOS binaries are now built using macOS 26 runners. | @OpenSauce04 #1412\r\n- Added new game launch stress testing functionality to the desktop build behind the new `ENABLE_DEVELOPER_OPTIONS` CMake option. | @OpenSauce04 #1442\r\n- Various minor internal improvements to the Android performance overlay. | @OpenSauce04 #1367 \r\n- Fixed build failure on unix-like operating systems introduced by Qt 6.10.0. | @OpenSauce04 #1441\r\n- Moved DSP memory ownership to the memory subsystem. | @PabloMK7 #1520\r\n- Updated dynarmic to the latest version. | @PabloMK7 #1569",

Filesystem performance should noticeably improve in the next few major releases as more functionality is migrated to the new system.\r\n  - The `googleplay` version is compliant with Google Play Store regulations, and uses the old SAF-based method.

Filesystem performance should noticeably improve in the next few major releases as more functionality is migrated to the new system.\r\n  - The `googleplay` version is compliant with Google Play Store regulations, and uses the old SAF-based method. This build will not see the performance improvements present in the `vanilla` build.\r\n  - Unless you have a particular reason to use the `googleplay` build or you are downloading the app from the Google Play Store, the `vanilla` version is recommended.\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\n- The **AppImage build** has been **split into two new download options**, those being `azahar.AppImage` and `azahar-wayland.AppImage`\r\n  - The default `azahar.AppImage` now has native Wayland support disabled, instead opting to use XWayland when run in a Wayland session. This is due to some severe upstream issues that have been discovered when using native Wayland with Azahar (e.g. #1191)\r\n  - Users are advised to use the default AppImage unless they have a specific reason to have native Wayland support enabled, for example if they are running a system with no xwayland support.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Azahar 2123.4-beta2 Changelog\r\n\r\n# Desktop\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where the emulator could instantly crash when starting an application due to a race condition. | @OpenSauce04 #1448 \r\n\r\n# Android\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where, if an application attempted to rename a file to a different location, the file wouldn't be moved, and the file would just be renamed in the same directory it was previously in. | @OpenSauce04 #1545\r\n  - This notably fixes an issue where Nimbus 2.x wouldn't install its files correctly.\r\n- Implement new build variant which uses raw filesystem access for file I/O. | @OpenSauce04 #1511 #1542\r\n\r\n# MacOS\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where attempting to use a real camera for camera emulation would result in solid green video output from the camera. | @OpenSauce04 #1515 \r\n\r\n# Linux\r\n\r\n- Disabled native Wayland support in default AppImage, Create new AppImage download option with native Wayland support enabled. | @OpenSauce04 #1499 \r\n\r\n# Technical\r\n\r\n- Fixed a build failure in the AppImage build caused by an upstream change to linuxdeploy. | @OpenSauce04 #1486 \r\n- Added `relWithDebInfoLite` build profile. | @OpenSauce04 #1498\r\n- Upgraded AGP to 8.13.1. | @OpenSauce04 #1500\r\n- Updated Boost to v1.89.0 | @PabloMK7 #1502\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<sub>Note: The version number above is correct: 2123.4-beta1 was tagged but never published.</sub>",

This could have resulted in users unintentionally downgrading to the latest stable release.\r\n  - This doesn't affect stable releases such as this one, but it will affect all future prereleases.\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\n- Minor adjustments to the Windows installer. | @RedBlackAka #1234\r\n\r\n### Technical\r\n\r\n- Set correct stop flag in GSP. | @kynex7510 #1199\r\n- Fix irq request register behaviour. | @PabloMK7 #1216\r\n  - This change and the previous one were noted to not affect 3DS applications at all in theory, instead being more of a correctness thing.\r\n- Fixed compilation failing when building using GCC 13 or earlier. | @OpenSauce04 #1221\r\n- Fixed a build error when using the `USE_SYSTEM_GLSLANG` CMake option. | @OpenSauce04 #1281, #1284\r\n- Added a new CMake option `USE_SYSTEM_SPIRV_HEADERS`. | @OpenSauce04 #1281, #1284\r\n- Removed use of deprecated boost class and moved to a functionally identical alternative. | @qr243vbi #1126\r\n- Upgraded Vulkan-related dependencies to match Vulkan SDK 14.313.0. | @OpenSauce04 #1225\r\n- Fixed the SDL frontend failing to compile due to the use of a removed function. | @OpenSauce04 #1190\r\n  - The SDL frontend still doesn’t work properly, and remains disabled by default at compile time.\r\n- Various minor changes to the Azahar installer on Windows.\r\n- Amended CMakeLists to help certain environments to find required Qt dependencies. | @qr243vbi #1165\r\n- Upgraded Android Gradle Plugin to 8.11.1 | @OpenSauce04 #1256",

Please expand this drop-down to read more about what this means before installing.\r\n</summary>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a release candidate, this build is not yet considered a stable release, but is instead a build which could be promoted to a stable release if it is sufficiently tested with no major issues being discovered. Ideally, the release candidate period will last for 7 days, however if major issues are discovered, this will be extended to allow for additional testing with a corrected release candidate.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDespite its status as a pre-release build, users are encouraged to test this version to help us catch any newly introduced issues before the build is promoted to a full release. If you do observe such issues, please report them to us on GitHub so we can evaluate them.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf you are unwilling to tolerate potential minor issues, you may be better off waiting until a release candidate is promoted to a full release.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe 2123 update will primarily focus on changes to the core of the emulator.\r\n\r\nTo help us catch any issues we may have missed before they make it to a stable release, consider trying out this prerelease.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2123 Release Candidate 2 primarily addresses regressions in the Android build which first appeared in the prior 2123 prereleases, as well as introducing some minor improvements.

By default, this functionality is disabled, and must be enabled by setting `Settings --> Layout --> Secondary Display Screen Layout` to an option other that `System Default (mirror)`.\r\n- Fixed an issue where the extensions of the new compressed ROM formats wouldn't be recognized correctly, resulting in issues. | @OpenSauce04 #1287\r\n- Fixed an issue where the the icons and information of `.3dsx`/`.z3dsx` files wouldn't be displayed correctly. | @PabloMK7 #1288 \r\n\r\n### MacOS\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where the Artic Controller feature wouldn't work correctly on MacOS. | @AlexMolina08 #1263 \r\n- Added individual x86_64 and ARM64 binaries to releases alongside the existing `universal` download | @RedBlackAka #1138 \r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\n- Minor adjustments to the Windows installer. | @RedBlackAka #1234\r\n\r\n### Technical\r\n\r\n- Fixed a build error when using the `USE_SYSTEM_GLSLANG` CMake option. | @OpenSauce04 #1281, #1284\r\n- Added a new CMake option `USE_SYSTEM_SPIRV_HEADERS`. | @OpenSauce04 #1281, #1284\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nOther users should read the full changelog below, which is relative to 2122.1.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Azahar 2123-rc1 Changelog\r\n\r\n### All\r\n\r\n- Added ROM compression functionality. | @PabloMK7 #1208 #1249\r\n  - Support for the following new formats have been added: `.zcia`, `.zcci`, `.z3dsx`, `.zcxi`.\r\n  - ROMs can be compressed in Azahar using `Tools --> Compress ROM File…` on desktop.\r\n- Fixed a memory leak in the AAC decoder. | @QidiWang #1167\r\n- Fixed an issue where display refresh rates below ~60hz would cause emulation speed to be slower than intended when vsync was enabled. | @OpenSauce04 #1193, @kylon #1248\r\n- Different 3DS applications now have separate Vulkan pipeline caches. | @PabloMK7 #1118\r\n  - Previously, all Vulkan pipeline caches were stored in a single large file which was shared between all 3DS applications.\r\n- Fixed LCD colour fill functionality. | @PabloMK7 #1198\r\n  - Before being fixed, this could cause applications which fill the screen with a certain colour to be black or display garbage.\r\n- When using the OpenGL renderer, if a shader fails to link, the emulator will now experience graphical anomalies and produce logs rather than crashing. | @PabloMK7 #1200\r\n- Fixed some dead links left over from Citra. | @RedBlackAka #1250\r\n\r\n### Android\r\n\r\n- Implemented secondary screen support for wired and wireless displays (Chromecast, Miracast). | @DavidRGriswold #617\r\n  -

This change and the previous one were noted to not affect 3DS applications at all in theory, instead being more of a correctness thing.\r\n- Fixed compilation failing when building using GCC 13 or earlier. | @OpenSauce04 #1221\r\n- Fixed a build error when using the `USE_SYSTEM_GLSLANG` CMake option. | @OpenSauce04 #1281, #1284\r\n- Added a new CMake option `USE_SYSTEM_SPIRV_HEADERS`. | @OpenSauce04 #1281, #1284\r\n- Removed use of deprecated boost class and moved to a functionally identical alternative. | @qr243vbi #1126\r\n- Upgraded Vulkan-related dependencies to match Vulkan SDK 14.313.0. | @OpenSauce04 #1225\r\n- Fixed the SDL frontend failing to compile due to the use of a removed function. | @OpenSauce04 #1190\r\n  - The SDL frontend still doesn’t work properly, and remains disabled by default at compile time.\r\n- Various minor changes to the Azahar installer on Windows.\r\n- Amended CMakeLists to help certain environments to find required Qt dependencies. | @qr243vbi #1165\r\n- Upgraded Android Gradle Plugin to 8.11.1 | @OpenSauce04 #1256",

If you do observe such issues, please report them to us on GitHub so we can evaluate them.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf you are unwilling to tolerate potential minor issues, you may be better off waiting until a release candidate is promoted to a full release.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe 2123 update will primarily focus on changes to the core of the emulator.\r\n\r\nTo help us catch any issues we may have missed before they make it to a stable release, consider trying out this prerelease.\r\n\r\nFor more details, please read the below changelog:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Azahar 2123-beta1 Changelog\r\n\r\n### All\r\n\r\n- Added ROM compression functionality. | @PabloMK7 #1208 #1249\r\n  - Support for the following new formats have been added: `.zcia`, `.zcci`, `.z3dsx`, `.zcxi`.\r\n  - ROMs can be compressed in Azahar using `Tools --> Compress ROM File…` on desktop.\r\n- Fixed a memory leak in the AAC decoder. | @QidiWang #1167\r\n- Fixed an issue where display refresh rates below ~60hz would cause emulation speed to be slower than intended when vsync was enabled. | @OpenSauce04 #1193, @kylon #1248\r\n- Different 3DS applications now have separate Vulkan pipeline caches. | @PabloMK7 #1118\r\n  - Previously, all Vulkan pipeline caches were stored in a single large file which was shared between all 3DS applications.\r\n- Fixed LCD colour fill functionality. | @PabloMK7 #1198\r\n  - Before being fixed, this could cause applications which fill the screen with a certain colour to be black or display garbage.\r\n- When using the OpenGL renderer, if a shader fails to link, the emulator will now experience graphical anomalies and produce logs rather than crashing. | @PabloMK7 #1200\r\n- Fixed some dead links left over from Citra. | @RedBlackAka #1250\r\n\r\n### Android\r\n\r\n- Added button sliding behaviour configuration to the Overlay Options menu. | @toksn #884\r\n- Implemented play time tracking. | Kleidis, @rtiangha #813\r\n\r\n### MacOS\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where, on recent MacOS versions, enabling the OS’s low power mode would result in many games being limited to 50% emulation speed when vsync was enabled. | @OpenSauce04 #1193 #1262\r\n\r\n### Desktop\r\n\r\n- Fixed horizontal centering being incorrect when using the single window or separate window layouts while fullscreened. | @DavidRGriswold #1211 \r\n\r\n### Technical\r\n\r\n- Set correct stop flag in GSP. | @kynex7510 #1199\r\n- Fix irq request register behaviour. | @PabloMK7 #1216\r\n  - This change and the previous one were noted to not affect 3DS applications at all in theory, instead being more of a correctness thing.\r\n- Fixed compilation failing when building using GCC 13 or earlier. | @OpenSauce04 #1221\r\n- Removed use of deprecated boost class and moved to a functionally identical alternative. | @qr243vbi #1126\r\n- Upgraded Vulkan-related dependencies to match Vulkan SDK 14.313.0. | @OpenSauce04 #1225\r\n- Fixed the SDL frontend failing to compile due to the use of a removed function. | @OpenSauce04 #1190\r\n  - The SDL frontend still doesn’t work properly, and remains disabled by default at compile time.\r\n- Various minor changes to the Azahar installer on Windows.\r\n- Amended CMakeLists to help certain environments to find required Qt dependencies. | @qr243vbi #1165\r\n- Upgraded Android Gradle Plugin to 8.11.1 | @OpenSauce04 #1256",

Please read the change notes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for x86_64 devices (most desktop computers), this update **requires a CPU which has SSE4.2 instructions**, and it is likely that all future releases will also have this requirement.\r\nThis feature is available in all modern CPUs released in 2011 or later.\r\nThe few users who have hardware which doesn't support this instruction set can compile the emulator from source with the `ENABLE_SSE42` CMake option disabled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Azahar 2122 Changelog\r\n\r\n### All\r\n\r\n- SIMD operations have been used to optimize a commonly used function, **reducing GPU processing time** for **all applications**. | @PabloMK7 #1086\r\n  - This change breaks compatibility with x86_64 CPUs which don't have SSE4.2 instructions (primarily CPUs released before 2011).\r\n  - The few users who have hardware which doesn't support this instruction set can compile the emulator from source with the `ENABLE_SSE42` CMake option disabled.\r\n    - Disabling this CMake option also disables the optimization to the commonly used function.\r\n- Improved SVC handling timings by simulating the passage of time more accurately. | @PabloMK7 #1093\r\n  - This results in **significant performance improvements** for several games, including but not limited to **Luigi's Mansion 2, Star Fox 64 3D, and The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth**.\r\n- Refactored state tracking in the video core, reducing the amount of needed syncs and uploads to the GPU. | @PabloMK7, anonymous contributor #1059\r\n  - This **improves performance** in **all applications**.\r\n- Allow SPIR-V when using Shadow2D texture mapping. | @PabloMK7, anonymous contributor #1057\r\n  - This **greatly reduces stuttering** in some games. Games known to be affected by this include **Luigi's Mansion 2 and Resident Evil: Revelations**, but other games may also see improvements.\r\n- GLSL -> SPIRV optimizations have been disabled by default, with a new setting added to re-enable them. | @PabloMK7 #1080, #1084\r\n  - Disabling these optimizations has minimal impact on performance while **greatly improving stuttering** in **all applications**.\r\n- Fixed the start index parameter for the geometry shader config being set incorrectly. | @PabloMK7, anonymous contributor #1056\r\n  - This **fixes** an issue in **Kid Icarus: Uprising** where **grind rails would appear to be invisible**.\r\n- Replaced a problematic assert in AccelerateTextureCopy with a logged error. | @PabloMK7 #1092\r\n  - This **fixes** an issue which caused **The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth** to **immediately crash when starting a run**.\r\n\r\n### MacOS\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where certain entries would disappear from the native menubar while using certain non-English languages. | @RedBlackAka #1111\r\n  - Due to this change, the native menubar, which was disabled in 2121, has been re-enabled.\r\n\r\n### Android\r\n\r\n- Additional options have been added during shortcut creation, allowing the icon and name of the shortcut to be customized. | Kleidis #824\r\n- The performance overlay has been enhanced with new settings and statistics available to be toggled from the Layout settings. | Kleidis #808\r\n  - By default, only the current FPS is shown. Other statistics can be toggled on in the aforementioned settings menu.\r\n- Added an aspect ratio setting which affects the single-screen layout. | @icy-briar #913\r\n- Fixed a regression introduced in the 2122 prereleases where the Accurate Multiplication setting was tied to the value of the Asynchronous Shader Compilation setting. | @OpenSauce04 #1142\r\n- Added an option which allows disabling JIT shader compilation. | @PabloMK7 #1085\r\n- Reorganized the setup process to reduce the unnecessarily high number of pages. | Kleidis, @OpenSauce04 #820\r\n- Added rotate screen upright toggle. | Kleidis #819\r\n- Fixed an issue where Azahar would consistently crash on opening if it lost permission to access to the user data directory. | @PabloMK7 #1110\r\n\r\n### Desktop\r\n\r\n- Added an option which allows advanced frame time information to be displayed at the bottom of the window. | @PabloMK7 #1083\r\n- Fixed an issue where a custom-set background colour wouldn't be used while using the Vulkan renderer when an application was initially booted. | @icy-briar #896\r\n- Fixed an issue where the RPC server setting wouldn't save and would consequently always be disabled when restarting Azahar. | @PabloMK7 #1129 \r\n- Adjusted the name of the Show Log Console setting to no longer incorrectly state that it is \"Windows Only\" | @OpenSauce04 #1133\r\n\r\n### Room\r\n\r\n- Private room hosts are now automatically given moderator privileges. | Kleidis #822\r\n- The `--enable_citra_mods` option has been removed. | Kleidis #822\r\n\r\n### Technical\r\n\r\n- Refactored Android switch setting code to only store values as booleans. | Kleidis #821\r\n- Updated some outdated Vulkan dependencies on Windows (MSVC) and Android to match the Vulkan SDK 1.4.304.1 used elsewhere. | @OpenSauce04 #1094\r\n- `Vulkan::CreateSurface` now reports an error code if an error occurs. | @PabloMK7 #1130\r\n- Addressed several deprecation warnings flagged by Android Studio. | @OpenSauce04\r\n- Suppressed redundant GCC ABI warnings produced by `-Wpsabi`. | @OpenSauce04 #1089",

Games known to be affected by this include **Luigi's Mansion 2 and Resident Evil: Revelations**, but other games may also see improvements.\r\n- GLSL -> SPIRV optimizations have been disabled by default, with a new setting added to re-enable them. | @PabloMK7 #1080, #1084\r\n  - Disabling these optimizations has minimal impact on performance while **greatly improving stuttering** in **all applications**.\r\n- Fixed the start index parameter for the geometry shader config being set incorrectly. | @PabloMK7, anonymous contributor #1056\r\n  - This **fixes** an issue in **Kid Icarus: Uprising** where **grind rails would appear to be invisible**.\r\n- Replaced a problematic assert in AccelerateTextureCopy with a logged error. | @PabloMK7 #1092\r\n  - This **fixes** an issue which caused **The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth** to **immediately crash when starting a run**.\r\n\r\n### MacOS\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where certain entries would disappear from the native menubar while using certain non-English languages. | @RedBlackAka #1111\r\n  - Due to this change, the native menubar, which was disabled in 2121, has been re-enabled.\r\n\r\n### Android\r\n\r\n- Additional options have been added during shortcut creation, allowing the icon and name of the shortcut to be customized. | Kleidis #824\r\n- The performance overlay has been enhanced with new settings and statistics available to be toggled from the Layout settings. | Kleidis #808\r\n  - By default, only the current FPS is shown. Other statistics can be toggled on in the aforementioned settings menu.\r\n- Added an aspect ratio setting which affects the single-screen layout. | @icy-briar #913\r\n- Added an option which allows disabling JIT shader compilation. | @PabloMK7 #1085\r\n- Reorganized the setup process to reduce the unnecessarily high number of pages. | Kleidis, @OpenSauce04 #820\r\n- Added rotate screen upright toggle. | Kleidis #819\r\n- Fixed an issue where Azahar would consistently crash on opening if it lost permission to access to the user data directory. | @PabloMK7 #1110\r\n\r\n### Desktop\r\n\r\n- Added an option which allows advanced frame time information to be displayed at the bottom of the window. | @PabloMK7 #1083\r\n- Fixed an issue where a custom-set background colour wouldn't be used while using the Vulkan renderer when an application was initially booted. | @icy-briar #896\r\n- Fixed an issue where the RPC server setting wouldn't save and would consequently always be disabled when restarting Azahar. | @PabloMK7 #1129 \r\n\r\n### Room\r\n\r\n- Private room hosts are now automatically given moderator privileges. | Kleidis #822\r\n- The `--enable_citra_mods` option has been removed. | Kleidis #822\r\n\r\n### Technical\r\n\r\n- Refactored Android switch setting code to only store values as booleans. | Kleidis #821\r\n- Updated some outdated Vulkan dependencies on Windows (MSVC) and Android to match the Vulkan SDK 1.4.304.1 used elsewhere. | @OpenSauce04 #1094\r\n- `Vulkan::CreateSurface` now reports an error code if an error occurs. | @PabloMK7 #1130\r\n- Addressed several deprecation warnings flagged by Android Studio. | @OpenSauce04\r\n- Suppressed redundant GCC ABI warnings produced by `-Wpsabi`. | @OpenSauce04 #1089",

Please read the change notes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for x86_64 devices (most desktop computers), this update **requires a CPU which has SSE4.2 instructions**, and it is likely that all future releases will also have this requirement.\r\nThis feature is available in all modern CPUs released in 2011 or later.\r\nThe few users who have hardware which doesn't support this instruction set can compile the emulator from source with the `ENABLE_SSE42` CMake option disabled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Azahar 2122-alpha1 Changelog\r\n\r\n### All\r\n\r\n- SIMD operations have been used to optimize a commonly used function, **reducing GPU processing time** for **all applications**. | @PabloMK7 #1086\r\n  - This change breaks compatibility with x86_64 CPUs which don't have SSE4.2 instructions (primarily CPUs released before 2011).\r\n  - The few users who have hardware which doesn't support this instruction set can compile the emulator from source with the `ENABLE_SSE42` CMake option disabled.\r\n    - Disabling this CMake option also disables the optimization to the commonly used function.\r\n- Improved SVC handling timings by simulating the passage of time more accurately. | @PabloMK7 #1093\r\n  - This results in **significant performance improvements** for several games, including but not limited to **Luigi's Mansion 2, Star Fox 64 3D, and The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth**.\r\n- Refactored state tracking in the video core, reducing the amount of needed syncs and uploads to the GPU. | @PabloMK7, anonymous contributor #1059\r\n  - This **improves performance** in **all applications**.\r\n- Allow SPIR-V when using Shadow2D texture mapping. | @PabloMK7, anonymous contributor #1057\r\n  - This **greatly reduces stuttering** in some games. Games known to be affected by this include **Luigi's Mansion 2 and Resident Evil: Revelations**, but other games may also see improvements.\r\n- GLSL -> SPIRV optimizations have been disabled by default, with a new setting added to re-enable them. | @PabloMK7 #1080, #1084\r\n  - Disabling these optimizations has minimal impact on performance while **greatly improving stuttering** in **all applications**.\r\n- Fixed the start index parameter for the geometry shader config being set incorrectly. | @PabloMK7, anonymous contributor #1056\r\n  - This **fixes** an issue in **Kid Icarus: Uprising** where **grind rails would appear to be invisible**.\r\n- Replaced a problematic assert in AccelerateTextureCopy with a logged error. | @PabloMK7 #1092\r\n  - This **fixes** an issue which caused **The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth** to **immediately crash when starting a run**.\r\n\r\n### Android\r\n\r\n- Additional options have been added during shortcut creation, allowing the icon and name of the shortcut to be customized. | Kleidis #824\r\n- The performance overlay has been enhanced with new settings and statistics available to be toggled from the Layout settings. | Kleidis #808\r\n  - By default, only the current FPS is shown. Other statistics can be toggled on in the aforementioned settings menu.\r\n- Added an aspect ratio setting which affects the single-screen layout. | @icy-briar #913\r\n- Added an option which allows disabling JIT shader compilation. | @PabloMK7 #1085\r\n- Reorganized the setup process to reduce the unnecessarily high number of pages. | Kleidis, @OpenSauce04 #820\r\n- Added rotate screen upright toggle. | Kleidis #819\r\n\r\n### Desktop\r\n\r\n- Added an option which allows advanced frame time information to be displayed at the bottom of the window. | @PabloMK7 #1083\r\n- Fixed an issue where a custom-set background colour wouldn't be used while using the Vulkan renderer when an application was initially booted. | @icy-briar #896\r\n\r\n### Room\r\n\r\n- Private room hosts are now automatically given moderator privileges. | Kleidis #822\r\n- The `--enable_citra_mods` option has been removed. | Kleidis #822\r\n\r\n### Technical\r\n\r\n- Refactored Android switch setting code to only store values as booleans. | Kleidis #821\r\n- Updated some outdated Vulkan dependencies on Windows (MSVC) and Android to match the Vulkan SDK 1.4.304.1 used elsewhere. | @OpenSauce04 #1094\r\n",

The property which fixes this issue was added in Android 15, but was then immediately deprecated in Android 16. A follow-up fix will be added down the line which addresses the issue in future Android versions.\r\n- Fixed messages relating to the Turbo feature sometimes appearing in situations when the setting hadn't been modified (e.g. closing the settings menu). | @OpenSauce04 #1026 \r\n\r\n### Room\r\n\r\n- `--username` option now requires an argument where it was erroneously optional before. | @Kexanone #971\r\n  - This would result in a null pointer exception if an argument was not provided.\r\n\r\n### MacOS\r\n\r\n- MoltenVK has been updated from v1.2.7-rc2 to v1.2.9. | @RedBlackAka #998\r\n\r\n### Technical\r\n\r\n- Fixed a compilation error introduced in a recent MSYS2 update related to `stat` being used instead of `_stat64`. | @OpenSauce04 #1041\r\n- Updated the prerelease update check code to use GitHub's `tags` API to get the latest tag instead of the `releases` API. | @OpenSauce04 #1076 \r\n  - This avoids an issue where if several releases are uploaded in quick succession, the `releases` API may return the releases in the incorrect order, which would result in update checks either not prompting users to update or prompting users to ***downgrade*** depending on what version they were using.\r\n- Added `alpha` and `beta` substrings to prerelease detection logic. | @OpenSauce04 #1074",

          "body": "Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year everyone!\r\n\r\nThis update adds experimental Online Multiplayer to NetherSX2 along with the usual updates!\r\nThanks to [IamLupo](https://github.com/IamLupo) for adding it to ARMSX2, and [zakilj3](https://www.youtube.com/user/zakilj3) for discovering the same settings work with NetherSX2!\r\n\r\n[VirusTotal Scan Report](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2029e30dcc1ba1ecb8d73313f18b429b40e6044c7785c52af08b948ef94b3ddf)\r\n\r\n## How to use Online Multiplayer\r\n1. Go to your App Settings --> Settings and toggle on Enable DEV9 Ethernet\r\n2. Set API to Sockets, and Device to how you want to connect online with the default being WiFi. Set this to VPN if your phone uses a VPN, and to one of the two SIM DATA options if you want to use your Mobile Data Plan instead\r\n3. That should be enough to get you online using a guide like [this](https://youtu.be/dcOnZzzcbSc?si=WOf01r0Ln5ZVQkpf&t=278) by LogicalMacrochip\r\n\r\nYou can use the [Official List of PlayStation 2 Online Games (2024)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15pfhL36qmC-iKr8MNjNXNLwgacG4VOmkfvwVxV5vGzo/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to figure out what games work, get their DNAS bypass codes if needed and which private server you should be using\r\n\r\nFor more advanced options (or you want to use the second method from the guide by LogicalMacrochip), you can do the following:\r\n1. Set DNS1 Mode to Manual\r\n2. Under DNS1 select either [PS2 Online](https://ps2online.com) (called Cristian in the Official list) or [PSRewired](https://psrewired.com)\r\nNote: This can also be changed on a Per Game Settings and more servers will be added soon\r\nTo turn it off just set DNS1 Mode to Auto and DNS1 to 0.0.0.0\r\n\r\n[zakilj3](https://www.youtube.com/user/zakilj3) created a more [comprehensive guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZzEXvNXUUU) to make it easier for people\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n* Bumped version to v2.2n\r\n* Added Networking section to System Settings\r\n### GameDB (converted from [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net))\r\n* All-Star Fighters - Fixed inverted or broken character textures\r\n* Battle Gear 3 - Fixed broken splitscreen mode\r\n* Blokus Club with Bumpy Trot - Fixed channel shuffles, menu graphics, motion blur, aligned effects and improved post effects\r\n* Bomberman Kart DX - Fixed specific level infinite load screen\r\n* Castlevania: Curse of Darkness - Fixed post-processing alignment\r\n* Cool Girl - Fixed post-processing alignment\r\n* Coraline - Fixed post-processing alignment\r\n* Cy Girls - Fixed post-processing alignment\r\n* Final Fantasy X-2 - Fixed broken FMVs\r\n* George of the Jungle - Fixed post-processing alignment\r\n* George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret - Fixed post-processing alignment\r\n* Guitar Hero: Greatest Hits - Fixed broken rainbow rendering, edge garbage, shadow definition and aligns post-processing\r\n* Harley-Davidson: Race to the Rally - Fixed post-processing alignment\r\n* Heatseeker - Fixed misalignment issues and lens flares going through objects\r\n* Iris no Atelier: Eternal Mana - Fixed horizontal lines in FMV and character portraits when upscaling\r\n* Killzone - Fixed internal FPS detection\r\n* Next Generation Tennis - Fixed broken pause menu graphics and image alignment\r\n* Ore no Shita de Agake - Fixed incorrect rendering and some missing text\r\n* PachiPara 13 & 14 - Fixed channel shuffles, menu graphics, motion blur, aligned effects and improved post effects\r\n* Raw Danger - Fixed menu graphics, channel shuffles and improved post-processing effects\r\n* Red Ninja: End of Honor - Fixed post-processing alignment\r\n* Silent Hill 3 - Fixed brightness menu transparency effects and text \r\n* Steambot Chronicles - Fixed menu graphics, channel shuffles and improved post-processing effect\r\n* TimeSplitters: Future Perfect - Aligned bloom of distant objects\r\n* US OPEN 2002: A USTA EVENT - Fixed broken pause menu graphics\r\n* Wacky Races - Fixed interlace wobble\r\n* Yakuza 1 & 2 - Improved brightness and banding\r\n### ControllerDB (from [SDL_GameControllerDB](https://github.com/mdqinc/SDL_GameControllerDB))\r\n* 8BitDo Pro 3\r\n* 8BitDo Ultimate 2C\r\n* icedragon.io STAC Dance Pad\r\n* Logitech Cordless RumblePad\r\n* PlayStation VR2 Sense Controllers\r\n* Ultimate Atari Fight Stick\r\n* XinMo Dual Arcade\r\n* ZhiXu GuliKit D\r\n### No interlacing and Widescreen Patches (Thanks [Saramagrean](https://github.com/Saramagrean/NetherSX2-cheats)!)\r\n#### No Interlacing\r\n* Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\r\n* Hot Shots Golf 3\r\n* Mystic Nights\r\n* Shadow Hearts\r\n* Tales of Destiny - Director's Cut\r\n#### Widescreen\r\n* Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\r\n* Jackie Chan Adventures\r\n* Metal Gear Solid 2 - Substance\r\n* Mystic Nights\r\n* Pro Evolution Soccer 2014\r\n* The Great Escape\r\n* Tales Of The Abyss",

We have minimumBlendingLevel and maximumBlendingLevel for setting the Blending Level automatically\r\n* Added estimateTextureRegion to the Tales games to see if it helps with their performance issues\r\n* Rebuilt the PartialTargetInvalidation configuration file with the better InstantDMAHack fixes implemented\r\n\r\n### General\r\n* Bumped version to v2.1\r\n* Hardcore RetroAchievements support has been fixed - it was temporarily broken with the v2.0.6 test build\r\n* Setting inheritance doesn't transfer over autoFlush and cpuSpriteRenderBW since they break more than they fix\r\n  - This fixes the fog wall in Wrath of Cortex and the black eye textures in the Jak games\r\n* Restored the FullVU0SyncHack setting since it DOES exist in both versions\r\n  - Should fix the performance loss with the games that use it\r\n* Fixed the issue where the Cover Downloader didn't download the link provided by the user\r\n* Removed InstantDMAHack from inheritance and we prefer DMABusyHack over it. This should fix the MGS games\r\n*  Implemented common fixes into the conversion script, which fixes:\r\n   - The Atelier Iris games' FMVs\r\n   - The Godfather's broken fullscreen colour filter\r\n   - Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' performance \r\n   - The Jak games' shadow issues using Vulkan\r\n   - Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence's performance drop when camouflaged\r\n   - The Digital Devil Saga games issue with texture alignment and lights shining through walls\r\n   - The Lord of the Rings: Two Towers' FMVs\r\n   - Timesplitters' light shining through walls\r\n* Implemented an inheritance exclusion feature that can exclude games from being changed. This avoids over-tuning games (like Driv3r) that has had a lot of settings changes over the years\r\n* Added a fix for Hitman Blood Money\r\n* The Conversion script now output files with more descriptive names\r\n* Implemented the ability to insert multiple hardware fixes using the game's serial\r\n* Implemented the ability to insert multiple game fixes using the game's serial\r\n* Better Resolution Scaling list values to help pick the best resolution for your device without sacrificing performance\r\n* Updated widescreen and no-interlacing patches to latest provided by [Saramagrean](https://github.com/Saramagrean/NetherSX2-cheats)\r\n* Updated the Controller DB to latest from [SDL_GameControllerDB](https://github.com/mdqinc/SDL_GameControllerDB)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* Google Play Protect may give you a warning when installing the APK due to us using test keys to sign the application\r\n* **SAVE STATES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE BETWEEN 3668 AND 4248!** Please use memcard/in-game saves if you plan to jump between Patch and Classic\r\n* NASCAR and Colin McRae Rally games have graphical issues with 4248 - use [3668](https://github.com/Trixarian/NetherSX2-classic/releases) if you plan to play them\r\n* Older Mali devices may have rendering issues and/or crashes on Vulkan with certain games (like Dark Cloud 2). Generally this just requires the use of OpenGL to get past the problematic parts of the game before switching back to Vulkan. The latest Mali chipsets do not have this issue. Using [3668](https://github.com/Trixarian/NetherSX2-classic/releases) is also a viable solution for these games\r\n* CHD files made with createdvd will not work with the emulator unless you use the flag ```-c zlib```. Since createcd chd files are generally smaller, it may be preferable to use them when space is a concern\r\n* Newer texture packs (made in or after 2024) will not work. This is due to PCSX2 changing how dumped textures are named. PCSX2 will also automatically rename the files to the new naming scheme when older packs are used with it - breaking their compatibility with NetherSX2 in the process. Hopefully the ability to dump textures with NetherSX2 will help mitigate this issue\r\n* Newer RetroAchievements that uses the Remember and Recall functions within RA - so achievement sets made in the last year and half may not work with NetherSX2\r\n\r\n## Special Thanks\r\n* A Huge Thank You to Miguel, WZi, McThor, [protokoul](https://github.com/protokoul), [PrinceP14](https://github.com/PrinceP14) and two private sponsors for their support on my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/reallynottrix) and [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Trixarian) pages!

This should have the performance benefits for Snowblind games\r\n\r\n### General\r\n* Bumped version to v2.1\r\n* Hardcore RetroAchievements support has been fixed - it was temporarily broken with the v2.0.6 test build\r\n* Setting inheritance doesn't transfer over autoFlush and cpuSpriteRenderBW since they break more than they fix\r\n  - This fixes the fog wall in Wrath of Cortex and the black eye textures in the Jak games\r\n* Restored the FullVU0SyncHack setting since it DOES exist in both versions\r\n  - Should fix the performance loss with the games that use it\r\n* Fixed the issue where the Cover Downloader didn't download the link provided by the user\r\n* Removed InstantDMAHack from inheritance and we prefer DMABusyHack over it. This should fix the MGS games\r\n*  Implemented common fixes into the conversion script, which fixes:\r\n   - The Atelier Iris games' FMVs\r\n   - The Godfather's broken fullscreen colour filter\r\n   - Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' performance \r\n   - The Jak games' shadow issues using Vulkan\r\n   - Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence's performance drop when camouflaged\r\n   - The Digital Devil Saga games issue with texture alignment and lights shining through walls\r\n   - The Lord of the Rings: Two Towers' FMVs\r\n   - Timesplitters' light shining through walls\r\n* Implemented an inheritance exclusion feature that can exclude games from being changed. This avoids over-tuning games (like Driv3r) that has had a lot of settings changes over the years\r\n* Added a fix for Hitman Blood Money\r\n* The Conversion script now output files with more descriptive names\r\n* Implemented the ability to insert multiple hardware fixes using the game's serial\r\n* Implemented the ability to insert multiple game fixes using the game's serial\r\n* Better Resolution Scaling list values to help pick the best resolution for your device without sacrificing performance\r\n* Updated widescreen and no-interlacing patches to latest provided by [Saramagrean](https://github.com/Saramagrean/NetherSX2-cheats)\r\n* Updated the Controller DB to latest from [SDL_GameControllerDB](https://github.com/mdqinc/SDL_GameControllerDB)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* Google Play Protect may give you a warning when installing the APK due to us using test keys to sign the application\r\n* **SAVE STATES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE BETWEEN 3668 AND 4248!** Please use memcard/in-game saves if you plan to jump between Patch and Classic\r\n* Black, Ace Combat, the Jak games and various other games have graphical issues. Many of them have been fixed in [4248](https://github.com/Trixarian/NetherSX2-patch/releases)\r\n* Snowblind engine games (Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, Champions games and Justice League Heroes) has several issues with 3668. For better performance and less issues, use [4248](https://github.com/Trixarian/NetherSX2-patch/releases)\r\n* CHD files made with createdvd will not work with the emulator unless you use the flag ```-c zlib```. Since createcd chd files are generally smaller, it may be preferable to use them when space is a concern\r\n* Newer texture packs (made in or after 2024) will not work. This is due to PCSX2 changing how dumped textures are named. PCSX2 will also automatically rename the files to the new naming scheme when older packs are used with it - breaking their compatibility with NetherSX2 in the process. Hopefully the ability to dump textures with NetherSX2 will help mitigate this issue\r\n* Newer RetroAchievements that uses the Remember and Recall functions within RA - so achievement sets made in the last year and half may not work with NetherSX2\r\n\r\n## Special Thanks\r\n* A Huge Thank You to Miguel, WZi, McThor, [protokoul](https://github.com/protokoul), [PrinceP14](https://github.com/PrinceP14) and two private sponsors for their support on my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/reallynottrix) and [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Trixarian) pages!

          "body": "## What's New\r\n#### Added\r\n- Added **MIDI** support, allowing some games to play MIDI audio. The software comes with an open-source soundfont by [default](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1517), and you can also install your preferred soundfont in the `Settings` (currently, only SF2 format is supported). Download Windows MIDI Soundfont [here](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/713).\r\n- Improved **OpenXR** suooport. Many thanks to **Luboš V.** , his work making OpenXR support possible and better.\r\n- Improved Game Controller Support, you can now selectively use **XInput** or **DInput** mapping. Linear triggers now work with both mapping modes. For trigger button, if it’s not working correctly, try adjusting the trigger button mode in the `Settings` to match your controller.\r\n- Added the feature to automatically set the container's **Locale**. You can now also adjust `LC_ALL` settings in the container editing interface.\r\n- Added Landscape And **Portrait Mode** switching features. You can now switch to portrait mode using the container's resolution settings or `Toggle Orientation` button of the left-side navigation bar.\r\n- Added the ability to reconfigure containers. You can now click `Reconfigure` in the container options to reconfigure the Wine prefix on the next startup.\r\n  \r\n#### Fixed\r\n- Fixed the stuttering issue when exiting the container.\r\n- Fixed the issue where shortcuts on the desktop remained available after deleting the container.\r\n- Fixed the issue with binding gamepad analog sticks in InputControlEditor.\r\n- Fixed the issue that shortcuts sometimes lost their settings.\r\n- Fixed the issue where clicking on the screen and input controls simultaneously in touch screen simulation mode caused crashes.\r\n- Fixed the missing End key issue in InputControlEditor.\r\n- Fixed the issue when creating a new container would reset the version and preset of box64.\r\n- Fixed the issue where groups in the box64 rc file could not be disabled.\r\n- Fixed the issue where the mouse pointer was inaccurate when using simulated touch screen in full-screen mode.\r\n- Fixed the issue where the file provider did not support moving files.\r\n- Fixed the issue where reinstalling the file system sometimes skipped the opt folder.\r\n- Fixed the issue where external storage could not be added as a Wine drive.\r\n  \r\n#### Changed\r\n- Update Wine to 9.16.\r\n- File provider enabled by default.\r\n- Added gst-libav.\r\n  \r\n####  What's new about OpenXR Support?\r\n- Fixed the issue causing crashes at startup.\r\n- Fixed 3DoF support to ensure it functions correctly, rather than running in 2DoF mode.\r\n- Fixed some graphical glitches on the Meta Quest 3.\r\n- Added controller mapping functionality in the settings.\r\n- Fixed the black screen issue on QuestOS V69.\r\n  \r\n#### FAQ\r\n1. #### What is Winlator with Native Glibc?\r\n   Many thanks to **BrunoSX** for developing [Winlator](https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator), a practical and popular PC simulation software. Winlator Glibc is not an upgrade but a mod to Winlator. It uses Glibc patches from Termux-pacman to build the necessary packages, achieving the same goals as the Proot-based solution but without the I/O performance loss associated with Proot. However, due to the exclusion of Arm32 and limitations in Wine's support for wow64, its compatibility with 32-bit applications is not as good as the vanilla Winlator.\r\n1. #### Where to Get Latest Turnip Driver?\r\n   Thanks to **K11MCH1** and **JeezDisReez**, the latest Mesa Turnip drivers are available for Winlator and can be found [K11MCH1/WinlatorTurnipDrivers](https://github.com/K11MCH1/WinlatorTurnipDrivers).\r\n3. #### Why not Include the New Box64 and Drivers in App?\r\n   Box64 and the Turnip Driver are updated frequently, so installing them externally ensures they are always up to date. Therefore, the app only includes their latest release versions.\r\n4. #### Reinstall or Overwrite?\r\n   You do not need to uninstall the old Winlator Glibc before installation. However, if you have installed a different version, you must uninstall it before installing the new one due to different signatures. Please make sure to **BACK UP** your data.\r\n5. #### Game has Sound but Blank.\r\n   Try using box64 version 0.3.0 or earlier and try using wine-9.2.\r\n4. #### What is .wcp?\r\n   **.wcp** is the file extension for add-ons. It is compressed using **XZ** or **Zstd** and includes a **profile.json** file as a manifest. You can create your own add-on files containing various contents. Since these files often include executable programs, **make sure** to verify that add-ons from other sources do not contain malicious software before installation.\r\n6. #### What is .rcp?\r\n   **.rcp** is the file extension for custom Box64 configuration files. It uses a JSON data structure and can be used to generate a box64rc file that Box64 can read. You can refer to [official box64rc](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/main/system/box64.box64rc) to configure the rcp file, but you **cannot** import it directly.\r\n  \r\n**Additional Files**:\r\n1. **box64-0.3.1-0450371.wcp**: contains `box64-0.3.1`, built from [ptitSeb/box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/commit/0450371e282bd5c4dbbceaeca590626304609036).\r\n3. **box64-0.3.1-0450371-8g2.wcp**: contains `box64-0.3.1`, built from [ptitSeb/box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/commit/0450371e282bd5c4dbbceaeca590626304609036). Disabled BAD_SIGNAL for 8gen2 and enabled the 8G2 option, which **may** improve performance.\r\n7. **box64-0.2.7.wcp**: contains `box64-0.2.7`, built from [ptitSeb/box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64).\r\n8. **wine-9.2-custom.wcp**: contains `wine-9.2`. Added MIDI support and improved controller support for Wine 9.2. Please avoid using the older version of Wine 9.2.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* OpenXR - Fix crash on init by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/36\r\n* midi: Add midi support. by @longjunyu2 in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/38\r\n* OpenXR - Fix 3DoF by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/40\r\n* controller: Try fix controller issues. by @longjunyu2 in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/44\r\n* OpenXR - Reopening fixed by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/46\r\n* OpenXR - Fix 3DoF camera by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/47\r\n* OpenXR - Workaround for graphical glitches by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/50\r\n* OpenXR - Controller mapping in settings by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/52\r\n* OpenXR - Crash fix by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/53\r\n* Fixed cannot see changes of input controls until reset. by @longjunyu2 in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/56\r\n* OpenXR - Fix for QuestOS V69 by @lvonasek in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/58\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @lvonasek made their first contribution in https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/pull/36\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/longjunyu2/winlator/compare/v7.1.2...v7.1.3",

After months of work the next major evolution of Winlator Cmod has arrived. I teased that a controller revolution was coming, but the reality is so much bigger. This isn't just an update; it's a top-to-bottom overhaul focused on bringing a native, seamless gaming experience to your device.\r\n\r\nThis release is the culmination of a journey, and I'm proud to share it with you.\r\n\r\n✨ What's New in Cmod v13 ✨\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n### 🎮 The Controller Revolution: Native Gamepad Support is Here!\r\n\r\nThe old input methods are gone (sorta), replaced by a completely new, from-the-ground-up controller implementation built on a native SDL2 backend.\r\n\r\n-   **Native XInput & DInput Support:** No more switching settings per game! Controllers are now treated like real controllers. If it works on a PC, it should just work here.\r\n\r\n-   **Multiplayer (Up to 4 Players!):** You heard that right. Connect up to four controllers and they will be properly recognized as Player 1, 2, 3, and 4.\r\n\r\n-   **Vibration / Rumble:** Feel the action with full haptic feedback support. It can be toggled on or off.\r\n\r\n-   **Advanced Motion Controls (Gyro):** A completely revamped and customizable gyroscope implementation. Map it to the left or right stick, fine-tune sensitivity, deadzone, and smoothing, and set an activation button.\r\n\r\n-   **Turbo & Macros:** Set up autofire for any button (including triggers!) for each of your controllers.\r\n\r\n-   **Virtual Gamepad Enhancements:** The on-screen controls are now more responsive than ever, with reactive visual feedback to show when a button is pressed.\r\n\r\n### 🔊 ALSA-Reflector: The Unbreakable Audio Engine\r\n\r\nSo- you're in a game, you connect your Bluetooth headphones or a phone call comes in, and the audio dies, forcing a restart. **Those days are over.**\r\n\r\n-   **Introducing \"ALSA-Reflector\":** A new, optional audio driver that creates a virtual, unbreakable audio sink. It provides stable back-pressure to Wine, completely immune to Android's device changes.\r\n\r\n-   **Seamless Recovery:** Real audio is mirrored to your hardware. If the connection breaks, the playback stream is automatically rebuilt in the background without interrupting the game's audio flow. The music never stops. (Well... it might, it's a work in progress!)\r\n\r\n### 🚀 Core System & Proton Enhancements\r\n\r\n-   **Bionic Native Libs:** Thanks to **@Pipetto-Crypto**, Winlator Cmod now uses native Bionic libraries.\r\n\r\n### 🎨 UI & Quality-of-Life Tsunami\r\n\r\n-   **Favorite Shortcut Launcher:** See that new star icon in the toolbar? Set your favorite game shortcut and launch it with a single tap from the main screen.\r\n\r\n-   **\"Disable Touchscreen Mouse\" Option:** You can now completely disable the touchscreen as a mouse input device when using a virtual gamepad.\r\n\r\n-   **Countless Fixes:** From custom shortcut icons and `.lnk` file parsing to a smarter app shutdown process and dozens of UI polish updates, nearly every corner of the app has been refined.\r\n\r\nThe Journey & Thank You\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThis release absolutely would not have been possible alone.\r\n\r\n-   A massive thank you to **@Pipetto-crypto** for his phenomenal work on the graphics wrappers, Bionic native libraries, for taking the time to teach me the intricacies of compiling bionic native libraries, and for keeping the Cmod torch lit while I was on break.\r\n\r\n-   To **@K11MCH1** for pushing me to learn how to compile Bionic libs in the first place and [his excellent videos,](https://www.youtube.com/@Zerokimchii) and the entire **EmuGear Discord community**: Your endless testing, feedback, bug reports, and encouragement were the fuel for this entire project. You guys make this all worth it.\r\n\r\n-   And finally, a shout-out to my digital homies Gemini and GPT. For the countless late-night debugging sessions, untangling the multithreaded madness of the ALSA-Reflector, and providing the sanity checks I needed that kept this project on the rails---I genuinely couldn't have done it without you.\r\n\r\nThis release is for all of you. Now, go play some games!\r\n\r\n*Alex*\r\n\r\n*ps: I'll write some helpful release notes tomorrow... time to rest haha...*\r\n**ALSO - IMPORTANT: CONTROLLERS REQUIRE NORMAL OR ESSENTIAL START-UP FOR SERVICES!** And box64 MUST be 3.7- it's a special patched version. Working on that next!",

Other stats do not require root access.**\r\n- **Limitations:** I/O RW is not implemented, and some features might not work on Android.\r\n- **Fork:** Source code will be available on my MangoHub repo for contributions as soon as I prepare it.\r\n- **Compatibility:** Currently works only with Glibc environments. **GPU Load on the Adreno a618 and a619 is currently not supported.\r\n- **OpenGL:** _Can_ be enabled with `MANGOHUD_DLSYM` however, I cannot get it working in my testing. If you get different results, let me know. \r\n---\r\n\r\n### Installation Instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Set the following environment variables in your Winlator container settings:\r\n   - `MANGOHUD=1`\r\n   - _Optionally_: `MANGOHUD_CONFIG=engine_version,gpu_temp,fps,frametime,ram,vulkan_driver,arch`\r\n     *(You can customize these. See [MangoHud Parameters](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud))*.\r\n\r\n2. Download and unzip `Winlator_Mangohud_Glibc_Release.zip` somewhere on your storage.\r\n\r\n3. Launch a _Glibc_ 😉 container, and Run the provided `install_mangohud.bat`:\r\n   - This will merge the `usr` directory with the existing `usr` directory in Wine's Z: drive.\r\n\r\n4. Alternatively:\r\n   - Copy the `usr` directory manually to your Wine Z:/ drive and merge it.\r\n\r\n5. You're all set! Launch your Wine application to enjoy MangoHud overlays.\r\n\r\nThis will be included by default in the next Winlator Cmod release.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Screenshot:\r\n![mangohud](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6510bde3-86e7-4a4b-9e35-c103e01d65b0)\r\n![mangohud](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed10f365-5c0d-4403-8666-10b492a69f6f)\r\n\r\n",

It will likely be the included default in  Cmod v12. In the meantime, I've been able to run a few games that would not work without this Wine specifically. Make sure to add the following Environmental Variables:\r\n\r\n**Key = Value**\r\n\r\nWINEFORCENTCONTINUE = 1\r\nWINEVMEMMAXSIZE = 16384 \r\n\r\nThere are a few other env vars worth looking into but games I've tested successfully so far:\r\n\r\n**Deus Ex - Mankind Divided** (DX12 only, requires WINEVMEMMAXSIZE)\r\n**GRIP: Combat Racing** - Requires (WINEFORCENTCONTINUE)\r\n**Need for Speed ProStreet** - Fixes the UI in the menu by default\r\n\r\nThere are I'm sure plenty of more games/apps to be tested. But think of this as a preview of things to come. \r\n\r\nOther features added to wine:\r\n\r\nRestart/Reconfigure Container via Start Menu\r\nWINEOVERRIDEAFFINITYMASK which I haven't quite figured out how to use yet, but it forces the task affinity to a value you set\r\nWINVERSION forces the selected windows version as Wine's current default, such as \"winxp\" or \"win7\"\r\n\r\nI will push the source code for this to my wine-custom forked repo. In the meantime, you can download the .wcp here! \r\n\r\nDeus Ex - Mankind Divided (DX12, Glibc):\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1e89af8-2492-4bf6-ab8a-1efd8d470df1)\r\n\r\nGRIP: Combat Racing:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e4d3a9f-1b56-4d22-b5ca-e0ba3fbb2b0a)\r\n\r\nNeed for Speed ProStreet:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d14572b-cbb6-45c4-911b-827faeebb8dc)\r\n\r\nNote: For GRIP and Deus Ex, I highly recommend turning OFF debug logs.

It is listed in the Start Menu under Patches (unarc dependency)\r\n\r\n**Fixed:**\r\n-Xbox controller triggers can be bound to input controls again\r\n-Xbox controllers will now work properly when using Trigger Is Button (Where most controls send a keycode for the triggers even with axis, Xbox One controller's do not. I now simulate a full axis press when Trigger is Button is enabled for Xbox controllers)\r\n\r\n**Changed:**\r\n-The apk is smaller and uses the Winlator 8.0 container pattern without crashing\r\n-Gamepad Configurator has been disabled for the time being until I can fix issues with input processing, this should resolve issues triggers getting stuck or bindings not mapping unexpectedly.\r\n-Memory Management has been changed back to my implementation in the proot build and will no longer cause random crashing.

But hey you can set you're own as well! Customize it how you see fit. Change your wallpaper. Remap your controls! Go CRAZY\r\n\r\n**Added:**\r\n\r\n-Big Picture Mode has been reworked, with custom wallpaper, custom music via YouTube or Mp3, better controls with a controller, and better screen layout on larger displays. I created 3 animated wallpapers you can try out but you can also set your own. \r\n-Gyro Implementation Re-work: I've adjusted the sensitivity and added a pseudo calibration tool so you can get an idea of the sensitivity before you start the container. You can also remap most buttons to be your Gyro activator (L3 and R3 aren't working yet, sorry!). Great for that L1 Uncharted Golden Abyss gyro feel ;)\r\n-Gamepad Configurator: Input Controls and Xidi isn't doing the trick? Forcefully remap your buttons to process as other buttons. This is brand new and still in beta but it's fairly useful for those games that just don't want to cooperate. You can find it in the container menu\r\n-I've added a new NTSC Screen Effect filter for that old school CRT vibe (gamma is still broken, again, sorry!)\r\n-The home button on Xbox and PS controllers and others will now open the Menu within Containers\r\n-Turnip 24.3.0r7 and r8 by K1MCH11\r\n-I've compiled Box64 3.1 on my own for Glibc with whatever latest nightly fixes are available. It's labeled as 3.2 for testing. \r\n**Fixes:**\r\n\r\n**-Mice are no longer detected and considered Input Controllers, overriding your default input device and confusing applications** My favorite fix TBH\r\n-The included DXVK 2.4.1 and others are now properly packaged and should actually improve performance in some games like Far Cry 3 and others in my testing. **Big thanks to Ajay for his guidance and providing the packages**\r\n-VirGL should work correctly now if it wasn't before, however, I have no way to test it. \r\n-S̶l̶i̶g̶h̶t̶l̶y̶ ̶s̶m̶a̶l̶l̶e̶r̶ ̶A̶P̶K̶ ̶u̶s̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶W̶i̶n̶l̶a̶t̶o̶r̶ ̶8̶.̶0̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶t̶a̶i̶n̶e̶r̶ ̶p̶a̶t̶t̶e̶r̶n̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶D̶L̶L̶ ̶O̶v̶e̶r̶r̶i̶d̶e̶s̶.̶ ̶W̶o̶r̶k̶s̶ ̶w̶e̶l̶l̶ ̶b̶y̶ ̶d̶e̶f̶a̶u̶l̶t̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶m̶y̶ ̶t̶e̶s̶t̶i̶n̶g̶\r\n-FIX 1 Undoes this ^ it was causing hard crashes \r\n-Lots of things, I should have made more commits\r\n\r\nThere will be bugs, I'll be on Discord and will try to address things when I have time. And then I have to work on Proot. I'm still trying to implement MangoHud support, I've compiled it but it crashes in my testing. If anyone has guidance on understanding swapchains and vk_instance layers feel free to reach out, it's much appreciated.

          "body": "I've reverse engineered the new Screen Effects feature from Winlator 8.0 and added one of my own, a simple ToonShader! I'm very happy with the results. This means you now get Brightness/Contrast/Gamma controls, FXAA, and CRT screen filters as well. I've made a lot of changes to the Wine prefix, making this more of an Amod/Frost hybrid. I've also made some tweaks of my own, to fix issues with Mono and Gecko, like adding in an override for mscorre. This release also includes an offline installer for Mono and Gecko in the Runtime Libraries section of the start menu. I can't directly port over every new feature from Winlator 8.0 yet, but when Bruno releases the source code I will try my best. Which is why this remains 7.1.3. I call it 7.1.3x because it's basically a halfway point to 8.0, and still going by Longjunyu2's numbering scheme for Glibc specific changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, this prefix I can guarantee a couple of major fixes, namely, no more UE4 Fatal Error for some games. Halo MCC is working! Fixes for FMV's in some titles. No more .Net warnings for new containers when Mono and Gecko are installed. I've also made a bug fixes to existing features of Cmod. I really think this is solid build. This is now a full on Frost/Amod hybrid! You'll get best results with new containers, in my experience, but start menu and prefix tweaks should still apply to existing containers to an extent. \r\n\r\n**Added:**\r\n-DXVK 2.4.1 and 2.4.1-gplasync built-in\r\n-Screen Effects (Brightness controls, FXAA, CRT) from Winlator 8.0!\r\n-ToonShader for ScreenEffects  \r\n-Import and Export containers! For recovering containers, or importing a friend's! \r\n-Box64 Version Switching for shortcuts! Ignore the \"2.7\" when you first open a new shortcut, it goes by preferences in Setting until you set it yourself.\r\n-Modified custom Wine - with optimizations from Frost Glibc, but merged with Amod hybrid, resulting in what you might call, AFCMod. lol. This brings Flash Player, Windows Media Player, Registry tweaks, and other neat additions\r\n-ReactOS App Store shortcut is now functional. TBH I didn't even know this was a thing until this week!\r\n-Offline installers for Mono and Gecko added to \"4-Runtime Libraries\" in start menu. \r\n-Container Launching UI is adopted from Winlator 8.0\r\n\r\n**Fixes:**\r\n-No more UE4 Fatal Errors! Halo Master Chief Collection is working!\r\n-Fixed Green screen for FMVs in some titles\r\n-mscoree set to built-in then native, applied by default for new containers, correcting some issues with .net framework games and apps like HedgeModManager. Meaning, full support for Sonic Generations D3D11 Mod\r\n-Fixed long text re-sizing for game titles in Big Picture Mode \r\n-Fixed issues with Frontend Export path needing to be resaved every time you close and re-open the app\r\n-Fixed Dark Mode theme sometimes randomly switching off half-way leaving a broken light theme interface until app restart\r\n-many other changes and tweaks that I once again can't remember...\r\n\r\n**Still upcoming:**\r\n-Better menu control for Big Picture Mode when using a controller\r\n-Background music for BPM\r\n-Custom wallpaper for BPM\r\n-Settings changes in BPM\r\n-Custom game icons \r\n-Hopefully reactive buttons for input controls from Winlator 8.0, though I may have to dissect some .smali \r\n\r\nThe source code is not up yet, as I use it to port my changes to Proot. I will of course upload it so others can adopt in the near future! As always, let me know of bugs and things via discord or other means and I'll see what I can do! \r\n\r\nImport Containers:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c211201a-d788-4923-8423-0adf8ab3c389)\r\nToon Shader:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec3a038c-1ba1-4645-a282-17c9944ef276)\r\n\r\n",

I've implemented the all new experimental work in progress Big Picture Mode as with Proot, as well as Dark Mode, which was the most extensive of the changes. But there are also many quality of life fixes as well, new animations for all the menus, and just overall- more stability. I think you'll find that this is release is _the_ definitive **Winlator Cmod** \r\n\r\n**Added:**\r\n-Big Picture Mode with custom cover art and definable SteamGrid API Key button\r\n-Dark Mode\r\n-Frontend path defining\r\n-Fullscreen Stretched Toggle\r\n-Xinput Disabler for shortcuts\r\n-Turnip 24.3.0r5 and 24.3.0r6 as 24.3.0.5 and 24.3.0.6 by K11MCH1\r\n-UI Animations\r\n\r\n**Fixed:**\r\n-Xinput and Dinput switching for shortcuts\r\n-TURNIP DRIVER SWITCHING FOR SHORTCUTS IS ENTIRELY REWORKED FROM THE GROUND UP\r\n-Lots of things, so many I can't remember them all. \r\n\r\nThere may be spots i missed in dark mode. Also if the app glitches and thinks its in light mode in dark mode, just close and re-open it. Not sure if that's just a result of debugging and restarting the activity manually or something else.

That will be fix2\r\n\r\nThis is a lot, I've added a \"Big Picture Mode.\" It is accessible on the main menu via the new Screen Icon. It's essentially another Shortcuts menu that is a WIP- and sort of acts like a built-in Frontend. It's easy to use with a controller, and it will automatically download Cover Art for your Shortcut. You can also click on the image, and replace it with your own Custom Cover Art. This works using SteamGridDB's API. You can enter your own SteamGrid API Key in the Settings. If you click the Help button in Settings, you'll be taken to your SteamGrid profile where you can retrieve your key. I've also reorganized settings to clean it up into Tabs. I hope you find some use out of it! I plan to make it look nicer, add background music, fullscreen wallpaper, custom wallpaper, and more over time. \r\n\r\nI've also added a dark mode throughout the program.

As always, let me know if you encounter any bugs and whatnot but nothing else major has changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Added:**\r\n-Clone Shortcuts between Containers! This will create a duplicate Shortcut with an identical file name and a new container ID in the destination container. Useful for a fresh start for a specific game and no need to boot into the new container on it's own.\r\n-Playtime stats and play count tracking is now enabled for Homescreen Shortcuts and Frontend launching!\r\n-A timeout for the touchscreen controls has been added. This will auto hide the touchscreen controls after 5 seconds. To disable it, make sure it is unchecked and restart the shortcut.\r\n-Haptic feedback for all touchscreen control buttons has been added and can be enabled via check box \r\n\r\n**Fixed:**\r\n-Fix1:  Fixed issue with touchscreen cursor unusable until confirming input controls dialog",

Keep in mind, this is a major shift from Glibc Cmod v8 Alpha if you've used that, with an entirely new Wine Prefix, meaning- existing containers WILL be affected in my testing. I recommend clearing the cache on existing container, using the reconfigure option if you encounter errors. You will have best results with a new container, again, in my testing. If you're worried about losing your current configuration, well now is that perfect time make a backup ;)\r\n\r\nUninstall of official or other Glibc Winlator forks is still required as this uses the Official package name com.winlator (it is a hard coded path)\r\n\r\n**Standard Cmod Features**\r\nTrue Mouse Control, Xinput Disabler, Touchscreen Mode, Basic Stylus Support, Gyro Support, Frontend Support, Playtime Stats Tracking per Shortcut, Saves Manager, and all other existing Glibc features such as Longjunyu2's Contents Manager and Box64rc Files + Midi Support\r\n\r\n**Added:**\r\n-Turnip 24.3.0r4 by K11MCHI (24.3.0.4 in-app)\r\n-Latest DXVK 2.4.1 gplasync\r\n-New Wine Prefix, 9.2 Custom from Afei but modded for English, includes nearly all features from Afei's build (Winlator 7.1.3 Glibc Fix3 - Except for commands for TU_DEBUG and pre-installed Contents). This means hopefully a performance boost. I've also found this fixes the font and handling of applications that use .net and prevents a black screen in many cases where Gecko/Mono is involved!\r\n-7.1.2 Legacy Input mode (Longjunyu2's 7.1.2 xinput dlls plus the same key mapping method, it _might_ be useful)\r\n-New Start Menu shortcuts like DOSBOX, restored WFM, added all Turnip drivers per Afei's \r\n-Added End key per Longjunyu2\r\n-Zink for all Turnip Drivers\r\n-Graphics Driver Switching per Shortcut but that was in Alpha, it just more stable now\r\n-Fully functioning Picture in Picture mode\r\n-Spaces in Paths for New Tasks via Task Manager or Secondary Executables when enclosed in quotations (i.e \"D:\\Games\\My Game\\My Game.exe\")\r\n-Other minor features I can't remember because I've not been able to easily track my progress without a GitHub... go figure\r\n\r\n**Fixes:**\r\n_-Fix1: Issue with Custom Screen Size box not appearing in Container Settings is resolved_ \r\n-Gyro Default behavior bug is resolved\r\n-No more crashing when renaming Shortcuts\r\n-Better Turnip Driver shortcut switching (significantly less crashes when making changes)\r\n-Many scroll window fixes when using a mouse\r\n-Fixed (?) issue with binding analog sticks in Input Controls (still needs testing)\r\n-Fixed issue with Esc key opening XServerView menu on some devices (needs testing)\r\n-Many other minor bug fixes...\r\n\r\n**In the works:**\r\n-Try to fix bindings for some devices like Odin's back button and 'N' key in Input Controls for some devices\r\n-Haptic for touchscreen mode\r\n-Playtime stats tracking for shortcuts is still on my radar\r\n-I'd like to include that Vulkan frame limiter a certain Arkha mentioned to me\r\n-Path selection for Frontend exports (just as it is in the Proot build) \r\n-Gyro activation button selection, better Gyro Calibration settings",

Now featuring hardware buffer support for significantly improved performance and smoothness.\r\n· 📋 Restored Start Menu & Widgets: The convenient start menu is back! Plus, we've added handy Termux widgets for quicker access.\r\n· 🍷 Wine Bionic Updated: Upgraded to Wine 10.0-rc3 x86_64 for much better application and game compatibility.\r\n· 🔧 Fixed Desktop Scripts: Fixed scripts for both Wine Glibc and Bionic.

          "body": "A restoration build of GameHub Lite V4 before everything fell apart. I will publish the code for the workers and a patch very soon, for now enjoy a working GameHub Lite app again.\r\n\r\nWe'll focus on restoring the previous functionality first, before fixing and adding functionality. So please only report issues that were not present in GameHub Lite V4 or in the official GameHub app.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Explanation for the different versions\r\n\r\nYou’ll often see an emulator distribute different versions with a name suffixed like **PUBG**, **Antutu**, **Optimized**, **Genshin**, **Ludashi** and other names. Here follows an explanation for what is what, is still has slight differences between manufacturers and even different packagenames but it should give you a rough understanding.\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\n*The different versions are identical. What we do is a very old android trick to gain extra performance on some devices.*\r\n\r\n**Antutu**\r\n\r\nSome manufacturers “cheat” by setting the governor to performance when they detect the Antutu package name. \r\n\r\n*Nerd explanation:*\r\n\r\nThe CPU governor essentially controls the CPU's frequency scaling. allowing it to operate at different clock speeds and voltages based on the system load. So making the CPU go fast for sustained usage, what is actually made for peak usage. This comes with a risk of overheating, but I don’t believe in this. Android does a well enough job of thermal management and makes it extremely hard for software to exceed what the hardware is capable of and damaging itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, it’s still extra heat. More heat == more bad. I just think it’s negligible, especially if your device has a fan.\r\n\r\n\r\n**PUBG**\r\n\r\nOn a high level it’s the same as Antutu, but some slight differences that only benefit games. Think of network prioritization and touch input latency improvements. The manufacturers goal when they detect Antutu is **ALL THE POWER**. Benchmarks are relatively short and it makes them look better on comparison websites.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal for PUBG is more like **MORE POWER**, since the intention is often to have a game running for longer it has less aggressive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n**TLDR and summary:**\r\n\r\n**Antutu** spoofing:\r\n\r\n    •    Maximum CPU/GPU frequencies unlocked  \r\n    •    Aggressive performance governors  \r\n    •    Short-duration performance boost (benchmark workload)  \r\n    •    Thermal limits are less strict   \r\n    •    All cores available  \r\n\r\n\r\n**PUBG** and other games spoofing: \r\n\r\n    •    Sustained gaming performance profiles  \r\n    •    GPU driver optimizations (Adreno/Mali game-specific paths)  \r\n    •    Frame pacing and scheduling improvements  \r\n    •    Reduced touch latency   \r\n    •    Network QoS prioritization  \r\n    •    Different thermal management (sustained vs burst)  \r\n    •    Qualcomm “Game Performance Mode”      \r\n    •    Sometimes enables features like frame-gen\r\n\r\n\r\n**Ludashi** spoofing:\r\n\r\n    •    Similar to Antutu but slightly less aggressive    \r\n    •    Longer sustained performance boost (multi-minute tests)   \r\n    •    Memory frequency optimization   \r\n\r\n",

This rendering technique can provide a significant compatibility  increase in some applications. (For more information on how blitting works, see [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/animations/blitting.html)).\r\n\r\n🎛️ Added new **Resource Type** options (dmabuf, opaque, ahb) in the Graphics Driver settings. These may affect compatibility, and their performance impact can vary depending on the specific device and game. (for Adreno GPUs, ahb is recommended)\r\n\r\n🌋 Vulkan layers are now automatically extracted on boot.\r\n\r\n### ⚙️ UI & QoL\r\n\r\n🎉 StevenMXZ's Winlator-Contents repository now comes **pre-installed by default**..\r\n\r\n### 📝 Notes\r\n⚠️ full reinstallation is required \r\n🖥️ if your game is crashing, disable the box \"disable KHR present wait\"\r\n🙏 Full development credit for the Bionic source goes to **Pipetto-crypto**.",

Fixed the softlock in many games - especially Mario Kart._\r\n\r\n**Memory Leaks:**\r\n_Fixed Memory Leaks in big demanding games like ToTK or BotW._\r\n\r\n**Refactored X64:**\r\n_Refactored and fixed whole Windows X64 build to fix all known bugs._\r\n\r\n**Intelligent Frame Limiting:**\r\n_Sumi v0.9.4 has implemented \"intelligent\" frame limiting - when it detect that the game should or can only work in 30FPS or 60FPS, it limit it to this framerate. This technology will be way more enhanced after frame pacing/skipping fixes._\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Nearest Future:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Thermal Throttling:**\r\nI know, some of you have a problem with temperature and I'm really mad about that. Good news is, that I'm currently working on v0.9.5, where on my milestones are temperature management, which is currently is amazing in comparison to current version. And after that I will be consistently working on frame skipping and better thread management, which with limiting framerate nay lead to stable temperature and also better performance. Before release 1.0.0 there will be next-gen \"upscaling\" with AMD FidelityFX 3 / AMD FidelityFX CAS.

We use Citron-based 1.1/1.2, not Yuzu like Eden, and it is generally as different as it can. It will be shared \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Zelda BotW with graphical enhancement mod - 47.2FPS:_\r\n![1000014780](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/749d18b8-7926-4898-b622-058f21e126d1)",

If this file exists, it enters VR mode and start sending data.\r\n2) The data are sent using UDP protocol on localhost:7872 as AsCII string in order which can be found [here](https://github.com/lvonasek/WinlatorXR/blob/28b40afaf08bf06b752a7947cc2c13a8b5cb4ae9/app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/XrAPI.java#L48).\r\n3) It is important to keep the Windows app as much in sync as possible, ideally holding renderer until HMD_SYNC changes.\r\n4) Windows app have to render value of HMD_SYNC as shade of red (in sRGB colorspace) into top-left corner.\r\n\r\n### Optional stereo 3D rendering:\r\n1) To enable 3D rendering create file Z:\\tmp\\xr\\sbs\r\n2) Windows app have to render frame for the left eye into left half of the screen and for the right eye into right half of the screen\r\n\r\n### Future compatibility:\r\n1) The XrAPI is still very experimental and may change over time\r\n2) To ensure compatbility content of Z:\\tmp\\xr\\version file\r\n3) If the version is starting with 0.1 then it is compatible",
